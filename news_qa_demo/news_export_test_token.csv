2ddec18b-c641-3755-81ef-b51dc087c040,Rate of Kids Hospitalized in Mental Health Crisis Keeps Rising,"TUESDAY, March 28, 2023 -- Children with mental health problems are flooding America's hospitals.
A new study of 4.8 million pediatric hospitalizations between 2009 and 2019 found that the number of acute care hospitalizations for kids with mental health problems increased significantly. In 2019, most were due to attempted suicides, suicidal thoughts or self-injury, researchers said.
""What we’re seeing are more and more hospital stays by children and adolescents due to mental health concerns in terms of absolute numbers, and a substantially larger fraction of these stays are related to suicide or self-injury,"" said study leader
Mary Arakelyan
, research project manager at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.
""With hospitalizations for mental health concerns representing a larger proportion of all pediatric hospitalizations in 2019 than in 2009, it’s imperative to consider how inpatient settings will meet the mental health needs of a growing population of young people,"" she added.
The study found that pediatric mental health hospitalizations rose 26% between 2009 and 2019.
And, over that same period, those owing to attempted suicide, suicidal thought or self-injury increased from 31% to 64%.
Senior researcher
Dr. JoAnna Leyenaar
, vice chair of research in the pediatric department at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, said kids with mental health issues go to hospitals because they have nowhere else to turn.
""Acute care hospitals provide access to care for youth and families when they’re experiencing a mental health crisis and aren’t sure where else to turn, when they need medical care for a suicide attempt or self-injury, and when they’re concerned that they’re not safe at home,"" she said.
The hospitalizations are a marker of the increasing prevalence and severity of mental health conditions in kids, Leyenaar said.
The surge likely owes to many factors, she said.
""We know that there’s a national shortage of mental health professionals and geographic disparities in mental health professionals who care for children,"" Leyenaar said. ""As a result, community-based treatment is often hard to access."" In many places, patients must travel a great distance to access care.
Meanwhile, the prevalence of mental health conditions in youth has continued to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said.
In addition, there are several risk factors for mental health crises, and many have been on the rise over the past decade. These include social media, poor sleep, and peer and family conflict, Leyenaar said.
A lack of community and school resources are also contributors, Arakelyan said.
""It’s likely that while other causes of hospitalization in children are becoming less common due to improved outpatient management, outpatient and community and school-based resources for mental health have not kept pace with needs,"" she said.
Leyenaar said it's important for parents to know that asking their children about suicide and thoughts of self-harm does not increase suicide risk.
""It may be protective, allowing families to seek support before a crisis occurs. Reducing stigma in talking about mental health conditions is also important,"" she said. ""Mental health symptoms are common in adolescents, and being open to talking about them and seeking treatment early may be really helpful for some youth.""
The study was published March 28 in the
Journal of the American Medical Association
.
A New York mental health expert agreed that there is a shortage of providers and lack of outpatient services to help kids who have emotional problems.
Dr. Scott Krakower
sees the result of that in his practice as an attending pediatric psychiatrist at Northwell Health in Glen Oaks, N.Y.
""We are swamped in our outpatient services,"" he said. ""We try our best but there are no other mental health providers to tackle outpatient needs.""
Moreover, there aren't enough mental health care providers to help children before or after a crisis, Krakower said. And most insurance doesn't cover the long-term care these young people need.
""Insurances have gotten tighter about what they will cover,"" Krakower said. ""Given everything that's happening, and because nobody wants to see people struggling with this, insurance coverage has been a big barrier.""
If earlier diagnosis and treatment were more readily available, many of these hospitalizations could be avoided, he said.
As it is, a young person may have to wait up to six months for an outpatient appointment because of a shortage of providers, Krakower said. The lack of outpatient care is often why children and teens aren't treated for depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts until a crisis occurs, and going to an emergency room is the only option, he said.

1f6239b4-0099-3ce5-8298-86edad16b206,AHA News: Irregular Sleep Schedule Linked to High Blood Pressure,"TUESDAY, March 28, 2023 (American Heart Association News) -- People with irregular sleep patterns may face substantially higher odds of high blood pressure than those who stick to a schedule, even when they get the recommended amount of sleep each night, new research suggests.
The study, published Tuesday in the journal Hypertension, found people who slept in on the weekends or varied the times they went to sleep and woke up throughout the week were substantially more likely to have high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, than those with more consistent sleep routines.
""This indicates that people may need to consider not only how long they sleep, but also recognize the importance of keeping a regular sleep schedule for optimal cardiovascular health,"" said senior study author Danny Eckert, director of the Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health and a professor in the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia.
The American Heart Association recommends adults get seven to nine hours of nightly sleep to promote optimal heart and brain health. The recommendation is based on prior research that found people who get less than six hours of sleep per night on average face a much higher risk for high blood pressure, obesity, cardiovascular disease and premature death. Likewise, those who get too much sleep – more than an average nine hours per night – face higher risks for high blood pressure, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and death.
The authors of the new study note prior research examining the links between sleep duration, nightly variation in sleep schedules and high blood pressure has relied on data reported over just a few weeks.
In the new study, researchers looked at sleep patterns over a nine-month period for 12,287 adults with and without high blood pressure from 20 countries. Participants were predominantly middle-aged men who were overweight. Data were collected from July 2020 to March 2021. The analysis included an average 181 nights of sleep data and 29 blood pressure readings for each participant.
The study defined high blood pressure as a systolic (top number) reading of 140 mmHg or higher or a diastolic (bottom number) reading of 90 mmHg or above. (The AHA and American College of Cardiology define high blood pressure as a systolic pressure of 130 or higher or a diastolic pressure of 80 or higher that stays high over time.)
The researchers used a device placed under the mattress to measure sleep timing (when people went to sleep and woke up) and duration. They found people whose bedtimes varied by 90 minutes or more faced 92% increased odds for high blood pressure, compared to those who stuck to a regular bedtime. But even those whose bedtimes varied by slightly more than 30 minutes from night to night were 32% more likely to have high blood pressure.
""This is a relatively modest level of sleep timing variability, given that people often stay up late on the weekends,"" Eckert said.
Sleeping late also was associated with higher odds of high blood pressure, but less so than not getting to bed on time. Waking up 43 minutes later was associated with a 9% increase.
As prior studies have found, the new analysis also showed a link between hypertension and getting too little or too much sleep. People who got less than seven or more than nine hours of sleep were 20%-30% more likely to have high blood pressure. People whose sleep duration varied by two hours or more from night to night were 85% more likely to have hypertension than those with less than an hour's difference in the amount of sleep they got each night.
Studying sleep patterns for nine months provides a more stable data set from which to draw conclusions about how sleep may be affecting heart health, said Dr. Reena Mehra, a professor of medicine and director of the Sleep Disorders Research Program at the Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center in Ohio. Mehra was not involved in the new study.
""If you're only looking at a span of weeks, that's a much smaller window of time,"" she said. ""If there's something unusual going on in a person's life, that's going to impact the findings. Whereas if you look at sleep patterns in totality over a span of months, that gives you a better picture of sleep-wake habituality.""
While work schedules and other commitments can sometimes make it hard to keep regular sleep times, the findings confirm the need for people to ""try to be as mindful as possible about sleep,"" Mehra said. ""Do the best you can to get consistency.""
