2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The 2020 Summer Olympics (Japanese: 2020年夏季オリンピック, Hepburn: Nisen Nijū-nen Kaki Orinpikku), officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad (第三十二回オリンピック競技大会, Dai Sanjūni-kai Orinpikku Kyōgi Taikai) and also known as Tokyo 2020 (東京2020, Tōkyō Nii Zero Nii Zero), was an international multi-sport event held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, with some preliminary events that began on 21 July.
Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013. The Games were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, but due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, on 24 March 2020, the event was postponed to 2021, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purpose. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and so far only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators. The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.The 2020 Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year and the first Summer Olympics since the 1900 Games to be held in a non-leap year.
New events were introduced in existing sports for 2020, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.The United States topped the medal count by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals. Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan won their first-ever Olympic medals.",726
2020 Summer Olympics,Host city selection,"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system. None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority.",126
2020 Summer Olympics,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"In January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Olympic Games. Tokyo organizers and the International Olympic Committee insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics. The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ""made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest"". Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event. Also unlike the case for H1N1 ""swine flu"" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020. In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate. In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19.Estimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency might be required during the Games. The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the Games were to allow spectators.",374
2020 Summer Olympics,Qualifying event cancellation and postponement,"Concerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China. The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3–14 February in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March. The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia. The European boxing qualification began on 14 March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled for April 2021. It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to Paris, France, because of renewed concerns over travel to the United Kingdom. Other qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and mid-2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo.",298
2020 Summer Olympics,Effect on doping tests,"Mandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety were their topmost priorities. The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3 February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month, and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March.",163
2020 Summer Olympics,Postponement to 2021,"The Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) released a statement on 2 March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were ""continuing as planned"". On 23 March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year. On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was ""paramount,"" and veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound said that he expected the Games to be postponed.On 24 March 2020, 122 days to go for the planned start, the IOC, TOCOG and prime minister Abe released a joint statement announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date ""beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021"". They stated that the Games could ""stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times"", and that the Olympic flame could become ""the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present"". Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded ""with 100% agreement"" to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in schedule.On 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would now begin with the opening ceremony on 23 July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8 August 2021, still to be held in Tokyo. The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4 February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named ""Here We Go"" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots.",414
2020 Summer Olympics,Calls for cancellation,"Health experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist. In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, Yoshirō Mori, asserted that the Games would be ""scrapped"" if they could not go ahead in 2021. On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games ""must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic"". Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was ""a mammoth task"" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021. However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.A member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a British Medical Journal editorial, which stated, ""holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes—ignoring scientific and moral imperatives—is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security"".On 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had ""privately concluded"" that the Games would have to be cancelled. The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were ""categorically untrue"". The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled. It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan.Public support for the Games in Japan decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country. Multiple organizations of medical professionals voiced oppositions to the Games, while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement. In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games. The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association called for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo ""have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity"" in an open letter to the prime minister. At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games. Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement.Kenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to ""prioritise life"" over the Olympics. Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa and Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled.On 26 May 2021, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which was a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to ""calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer."" On 4 June it was reported that Japanese sponsors proposed to the organisers for ""the Games to be postponed for several months,"" citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: ""It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower.""In July 2021, it was announced that all events in Tokyo were to be held behind closed doors with no spectators due to a new state of emergency. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun found that 55% of those surveyed supported the cancellation of the Olympics, and 68% felt that organisers would not be able to suitably control COVID-19 at the Games. The decision was also detrimental to local sponsors, which had planned in-person presences to promote their products during the Games; an executive of official sponsor Toyota stated that the company had pulled a television advertising campaign it had planned for the Games in Japan, citing that the Olympics were ""becoming an event that has not gained the public's understanding.""Had the games been cancelled, it would have been the first time since World War II that an Olympic event had been called off and the first games to be scrapped due to circumstances unrelated to war. A complete cancellation would have also cost Japan ¥4.52 trillion (US$41.5 billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity.",923
2020 Summer Olympics,Costs and insurance,"According to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK in March 2020, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year would be 640.8 billion yen (US$5.8 billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account.The Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games ""should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss"".The Tokyo Games were protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800 million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2 billion. The disruption caused by postponing the Games was covered by the insurance policy, with those likely to make claims for their financial losses including local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers.Holders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement were entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases, except for the costs of cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets were eligible to be refunded, organizers said that they would not release the total costs of the refunds. Reuters quoted industry sources who estimated that the Tokyo Olympics Committee had taken out US$500–800 million in insurance, and that after accounting for costs such as rebooking sporting venues and the Olympic Village, little of that payout would be available to recoup the proceeds of lost and refunded ticket sales. The local organizers are responsible for ticket sales and use them to defray the costs of holding the games; ticket sales were expected to bring in approximately US$800 million, but actual sales were close to zero.",412
2020 Summer Olympics,Public opinion and COVID-19 effect during and after the Games,"Prior to the Tokyo Olympics being held, many Japanese people were negative about hosting the event, but their attitudes had become more positive towards the end of the Games. According to a public opinion poll conducted jointly by the Nippon News Network and the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, which targeted Japanese citizens at the end of the Olympics, 38% of respondents said that it was possible to hold the Olympics in a safe manner against COVID-19, while 55% said that it was not possible. However, 64% answered that it was good that the Tokyo Games had gone ahead, while 28% answered that they wished the event had not been held. Of the respondents, 61% were glad the event had been held without spectators and only 12% said that spectators should have been allowed.On 29 July, less than a week into the Games, journalist Masaki Kubota reported his analysis of the Japanese people's perspective on the Olympics, which he believed was greatly influenced by the change in the way the Japanese news media reported on the Games. He pointed out that many Japanese news media had insisted on canceling the Olympics, citing fears that COVID-19 would spread, but once Japanese athletes started winning medals, the media changed their reporting policy and began livening up the Olympics, which had the effect of altering public opinion in Japan.Once the Tokyo Olympics were underway, followed by the Tokyo Paralympics, there was a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Japan, especially those caused by the Delta variant. On 26 July, there were 60,157 cases detected in Japan, breaking the record of 44,961 cases recorded on 10 May. On 9 August, one day after the Olympics had ended, daily cases in Japan reached 100,000 for the first time, and new cases continued to increase until the peak on 23 August, when 156,931 cases were recorded.",397
2020 Summer Olympics,Development and preparation,"The Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori, but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings. Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, was responsible for overseeing the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government.The Tokyo Metropolitan Government set aside a fund of ¥400 billion (more than US$3.67 billion) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government was considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line was planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost ¥400 billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) was also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport.There were plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-Ō Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area. The Yurikamome automated transit line was also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line was not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own.In April 2018, the Tokyo Organizing Committee signed a partnership with the International Labour Organization to ensure decent work in the preparation of and during the 2020 Olympic Games.In June 2020, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, Toshirō Mutō, stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings. On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games' logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants.",461
2020 Summer Olympics,Venues and infrastructure,"In February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics. In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and ""optimize"" the design.In June 2015, the government announced plans to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure. The original plan to build a retractable roof was also abandoned. At the end of 2015, as a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the new stadium (which had reached ¥252 billion), the government chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design had a budget of ¥149 billion. The changes meant the new stadium could not be completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended. The National Stadium, which was inaugurated on 21 December 2019, was named the Olympic Stadium for the duration of the Tokyo Games.In October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the Olympic venues could exceed US$25 billion.Of the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 were within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed. On 16 October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns. The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo.",455
2020 Summer Olympics,Security,"In December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A similar ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted. In July 2021, prior to the start of the Games, the Japan Coast Guard conducted counterterrorism drills in the Tokyo Bay. The drill consisted of two inflatable boats trying to stop a suspicious ship from getting to shore.",90
2020 Summer Olympics,Volunteers,"Applications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee. Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019. The volunteers at the venues were to be known as ""Field Cast"", and the volunteers in the city were to be known as ""City Cast"". These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were ""Shining Blue"" and ""Shining Blue Tokyo"", ""Games Anchor"" and ""City Anchor"", and ""Games Force"" and ""City Force"". The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games.As of early June 2021, approximately 10,000 out of the 80,000 registered volunteers resigned from the Games. Media attributed the rise in pandemic cases as the reason for massive quitting. More volunteer assignments were expected to be cancelled due to the spectator ban.",225
2020 Summer Olympics,Medals,"In February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017. A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year.In May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base. The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019.On 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled. The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition. A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.",263
2020 Summer Olympics,Torch relay,"The slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was ""Hope Lights Our Way"".As determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games, the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent. The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading ""Flame of Recovery"". After leaving Naraha on 26 March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals.After the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021. On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia. On 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned.The relay ended at Tokyo's National Stadium (Olympic Stadium) on 23 July, with tennis player Naomi Osaka lighting the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the opening ceremony. The cauldron lit in the Olympic Stadium was only used during the Opening and Closing ceremonies: a separate cauldron was lit on the Tokyo waterfront for public view at the Yume no Ohashi bridge in Odaiba.",474
2020 Summer Olympics,Biosecurity protocols,"In February 2021, the IOC began releasing ""playbooks"" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas around Greater Tokyo Area, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants would be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and would be tested at least every four days. Athletes who tested positive would be unable to compete and could be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway would be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts would also need to test negative in order to be cleared for competition. Athletes would be discouraged from ""excessive"" celebrations because the actions could spread infected droplets. The playbooks were criticized in a paper published by The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2021, for lacking ""scientifically rigorous risk assessment"" and failing to ""distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes"". The playbook stated that the athletes were required to arrive up to five days prior to the start of the competition and to leave within 48 hours of being eliminated from their sport or the conclusion of the competitions.The IOC recommended the vaccination of athletes against COVID-19 if vaccines were available to them, but this was not a prerequisite for participation and the IOC advised against athletes ""jumping the queue"" in order to obtain priority over essential populations. On 12 March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they were approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and would purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete. On 6 May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo.Approximately 93,000 athletes and officials were exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving in Japan, provided that they remained in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccine doses allocated for this group, this led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the Games and when teams returned to their countries.Due to international travel restrictions, the organizing committee announced in March 2021 that no international guests (including spectators) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting. On 19 June 2021, Governor Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead. On 21 June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever was lower.On 2 July 2021, the new TOCOG president Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility of the Games being held behind closed doors because of rising COVID-19 cases in the country. Japan's slow vaccination rate had been of particular concern. A simulation run by the University of Tokyo in May 2021 projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo had expired.On 8 July 2021, after Tokyo had recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12 July through 22 August (ending only two days before the Paralympics' opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area would therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that ""it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections."" IOC President Thomas Bach stated that ""we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants.""The announcement stated that spectators would still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima, Hokkaido and Ibaraki announced that they would prohibit spectators at events held in the areas. The opening ceremony was expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries, while some events did allow members of other competing delegations to occupy spectator seats as well. School students were invited to watch football matches in Ibaraki.On 16 July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions were to improve in Tokyo. However, on 2 August, Suga announced that all existing state of emergency declarations would be extended through 31 August, and be extended to Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and parts of Osaka.",1067
2020 Summer Olympics,Ticketing,"The opening ceremony tickets were expected to range from ¥12,000 to ¥300,000, with a maximum price of ¥130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events. The average ticket price was ¥7,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to ¥8,000. A symbolic ticket price of ¥2,020 was expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program. Tickets would be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the internet. International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent.Tickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24 March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered.On 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This included both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders would be refunded. Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system. It was ultimately announced in July that all local spectators were not allowed to attend any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido.",338
2020 Summer Olympics,Cultural festival,"A cultural program known as Nippon Festival was scheduled to coincide with the Olympics and Paralympics, running from April to September 2021 as a series of streaming events held by the Tokyo Organizing Committee and other partners. The events reflected the themes of ""Participation and Interaction"", ""Towards the Realisation of an Inclusive Society"" and ""Reconstruction of the Tohoku Region"". The program was either downsized or reformatted to virtual format due to COVID-19 and the postponement of the Games. One of these events was a concert held on 18 July, which featured J-rock band Wanima, choreography by dancers Aio Yamada and Tuki Takamura, and the presentation of animated ""creatures"" based on illustrations ""embodying the thoughts and emotions of people from across the world"".The original plans for Nippon Festival included events such as Kabuki x Opera (a concert that would have featured stage actor Ichikawa Ebizō XI, opera singers Anna Pirozzi and Erwin Schrott, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra), an arts and culture festival focusing on disabilities, and a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan shortly after the Olympics—which would have differed significantly from the traditional bi-monthly Honbasho tournaments, and featured special commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to spectators the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion.",307
2020 Summer Olympics,Opening ceremony,"The opening ceremony was held on 23 July 2021 in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. It included the traditional Parade of Nations. Emperor Naruhito formally opened the Games, and at the end of the torch relay the Olympic cauldron was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka.For the first time in the 2020 Olympic Games, it was decided that one male and one female in each country would take turns holding flags and serve as two of them. 
This was done by embodying the ""Agenda 2020"" set during President Bach's term.For the first time in the history of the games, a moment of silence was observed in the opening ceremony for the victims of the Munich massacre.",141
2020 Summer Olympics,Sports,"The event program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9 June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that their goal was to give the Games ""youthful"" and ""urban"" appeal, and to increase the number of female participants.The Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines. Karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding made their Olympic debut, while baseball and softball also made a one-off return to the Summer Olympics for the first time since 2008. 15 new events within existing sports were also added, including 3×3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as 9 new mixed events in several sports (table tennis, archery, judo, shooting (3), triathlon, 4 × 400 m relay running and 4 × 100 m medley swimming).In the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.",201
2020 Summer Olympics,New sports,"On 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are ""relevant to sports fans of all generations"", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 ""core"" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each.The decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original program for the modern Games. The New York Times felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport. Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.On 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling. The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu. At the 125th IOC Session on 8 September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.With the adoption of the Olympic Agenda 2020 in December 2014, the IOC shifted from a ""sport-based"" approach to the Olympic program to an ""event-based"" program—establishing that organizing committees may propose discretionary events to be included in the program to improve local interest. As a result of these changes, a shortlist of eight new proposed sports was unveiled on 22 June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu. On 28 September 2015, the Tokyo Organizing Committee submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding. These five new sports were approved on 3 August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and were included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33.",571
2020 Summer Olympics,Test events,"A total of 56 test events were scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.In February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner ""Ready, Steady, Tokyo"". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.All test events originally scheduled to take place from 12 March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games.",239
2020 Summer Olympics,Participating National Olympic Committees,"The Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"" in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games were North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name.Since competing as Swaziland ten times at the Summer and Winter Olympics, Eswatini made its debut under that name after the renaming of the country by the king in 2018.On 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it had provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they would be excluded from team sports. The head of WADA's Compliance Review Committee, Jonathan Taylor, stated that the IOC would not be able to use the ""Olympic Athletes from Russia"" (OAR) designation as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes could not be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against WADA's decision. After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 that the penalty placed on Russia be reduced. Instead of a total ban from all sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but the team would not be permitted to use the Russian name, flag, or anthem for a period of two years and must present themselves as ""Neutral Athlete"" or ""Neutral Team"". The ruling does allow for ""Russia"" to be displayed on the team uniform—although it should be no more visible than the ""Neutral Athlete/Team"" designation—as well as the use of the Russian flag's colors within the uniform's design.On 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym ""ROC"" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.
On 6 April 2021, North Korea announced that it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics because of COVID-19 concerns. This marked North Korea's first absence from the Summer Olympics since 1988. In September, a month after the games concluded, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was banned from participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, after they failed to participate in the Tokyo Olympics. On 21 July 2021, Guinea announced it would not be sending a delegation to the Tokyo Olympics, allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor. Guinea later reversed the decision and confirmed that it would be participating.

The following 206 teams qualified (including the 104 universality places guaranteed in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).",738
2020 Summer Olympics,Medal ceremonies,"Naoki Satō composed the music for the medal ceremonies. Satō chose not to employ any musical elements distinctive to Japan ""because victory ceremonies are for athletes from around the world"" and he wanted all medalists to ""feel at ease"" when taking their places on the podium, regardless of their nationality.The bouquets presented to the athletes came from regions affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The individual flowers were selected to represent the prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima, Iwate, and Tokyo. The sunflowers were grown in Miyagi, planted by families whose children had died during the disaster; the white and purple eustomas and Solomon's seals were provided by a non-profit initiative to boost the local economy in Fukushima; the small bright blue gentians were grown in Iwate; and aspidistras, grown in Tokyo, were chosen to complete the bouquets.",185
2020 Summer Olympics,Calendar,"The 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18 July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16 April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events. A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019.The original schedule was from 22 July to 9 August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364 days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21 July to 8 August 2021.
All times and dates use Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)",135
2020 Summer Olympics,Event scheduling,"Per the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals were held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games, which is one of the IOC's major sources of revenue. Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.",142
2020 Summer Olympics,Marketing,"The official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design was meant to ""express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan"". The checkered design resembles a pattern called ichimatsu moyo that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867. The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Théâtre de Liège in Belgium. The Games' bid slogan was Discover Tomorrow (Japanese: 未来（あした）をつかもう, romanized: Ashita o tsukamō). While ashita literally means ""tomorrow"", it is intentionally spelled as mirai, ""future"". The official slogan United by Emotion was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan was used solely in English.The official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics was Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered ichimatsu moyo patterns inspired by the Games' official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport. Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision. The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for ""future"" and ""eternity"", and Someity is named after someiyoshino, a type of cherry blossom. Someity's name also refers to the English phrase ""so mighty"". The mascots were expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals. For the legacy of the games on 3 January 2022, Ryo Taniguchi created Miraity (the future child of the mascots).",456
2020 Summer Olympics,Colors,"Alongside the main Emblem blue, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games were : 
  Kurenai red,   Ai blue,   Sakura pink,   Fuji purple, and   Matsuba green. These five traditional colors of Japan were used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations.",77
2020 Summer Olympics,Concerns and controversies,"Several controversial issues occurred during the preparations for the Tokyo Games. There were allegations of bribery in the Japanese Olympic Committee's (JOC) bid and of plagiarism in the initial design for the Games' logo. On 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics over Istanbul or Madrid. In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games. The official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, designed by Kenjirō Sano, were unveiled in July 2015 but were withdrawn and replaced following plagiarism accusations. The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his logo design was copied, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs.Mass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction. In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.Portions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the ""Recovery Olympics"" (復興五輪, Fukkō Gorin). However, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are still disputed. Some Tōhoku residents questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games slowed down recovery efforts, and that the region lost workers to projects associated with the Games.It was widely reported by international media that South Korea had asked the IOC to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics, claiming it to be a symbol of Japan's imperialist past, recalling ""historic scars and pain"" for people of Korea just as the swastika ""reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II"". Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is controversial because it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions, including the Attack on Pearl Harbor. According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea's request, saying, ""sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case by case basis."" Russian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan.In February 2021, the TOCOG president Yoshirō Mori resigned, after facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks. The previous conduct of the new president, Seiko Hashimoto, has also drawn criticisms, leading her to comment ""I regret it and think I should be careful"" on one of the accusations. The head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki, resigned in March 2021, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe. Sasaki's replacement, Kentarō Kobayashi, was dismissed by the Organizing Committee the day before the opening ceremony, after it was reported by Japanese media that he had made a joke about the Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, saying ""Let's play Holocaust."" On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee, described Kobayashi's jokes as ""outrageous and unacceptable"", but also said that the opening ceremony, which was directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned.The composer for the opening ceremony, Keigo Oyamada, resigned days before the ceremony after growing criticism of his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome. On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, TOCOG announced their support of Oyamada as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies, but growing criticism forced him to announce his resignation on 19 July. The opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included music from the Dragon Quest series, composed by Koichi Sugiyama whom The Daily Beast described as ""notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist"", leading to further criticism of the Organizing Committee.Officials reported that by early June 2021, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit. ""There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections,"" the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said, also stating he did not believe this would impact the operation of the Games. On 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors.Writing for The Conversation (website), Olympic scholar MacIntosh Ross raised concerns about the relationship between the IOC and WHO, suggesting the organizations showed a lack of concern for the health of Japanese citizens and Olympians.  As Ross explained, ""when the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it's difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.""A number of controversies arose during the Games, most notably the attempted repatriation on 1 August of Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, allegedly for her criticism of the national sports authorities and team management. Refusing to return to Belarus, over fears for her safety, Tsimanouskaya sought assistance from the IOC and traveled to Warsaw, Poland, on 4 August after being granted a humanitarian visa by Tokyo's Polish Embassy.Near the end of the Olympics, it was reported that Australian athletes had damaged the village rooms before departure, leaving a pool of vomit on the floor, damaged beds and a hole in the wall. Australian rugby Olympians also reportedly became drunk on the flight to Sydney, leaving vomit in the plane bathroom and receiving complaints from other passengers. Team Australia chief Ian Chesterman played down the incidents, and said that the Olympians would not be punished.",1398
2020 Summer Olympics,Broadcasting,"The Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 reached a global broadcast audience of 3.05 billion people, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Official coverage on Olympic broadcast partners' digital platforms alone generated 28 billion video views in total – representing a 139 per cent increase compared with the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and underlining the changing media landscape and Tokyo 2020's designation as the first streaming Games and the most watched Olympic Games ever on digital platforms.Sony and Panasonic partnered with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics. In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games. NHK broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of selected events in 8K. Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games.The Tokyo Olympics were broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserted that a ""right of abatement"" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to ""negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments"" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams. According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.In Europe, this was the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics covered almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia. Eurosport planned to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these were set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights. In France, these were the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France Télévisions. Eurosport debuted as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure.In Canada, the 2020 Games were shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN. In Australia, they were aired by Seven Network. In the Indian subcontinent, they were aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).",586

Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's 3000 metres steeplechase,Summary,"Beatrice Chepkoech came in to these Olympics as the World Record holder and World Champion, but she has not seemed as dominant in 2021. 2016 Gold Medalist Ruth Jebet could not return due to a drug suspension for using EPO. Silver medalist Hyvin Kiyeng Jepkemoi and bronze medalist Emma Coburn returned.
In the final, Chepkoech moved to the front off the line, the pack obliged her the lead as they got organized at a slow pace. After a lap, Peruth Chemutai stepped out to lane 2 and cruised from the back of the pack to the front to up the speed. For the next two and a half laps, Kiyeng, Coburn, Chepkoech, Winfred Yavi and Courtney Frerichs jockeyed around behind Chemutai while the rest of the sixteen starters struggled to keep up. Then Frerichs moved to the front, injecting more speed. The group of six broke off the front. Seeing the break, Maruša Mišmaš-Zrimšek almost sprinted to bridge the gap and joining the group. After another lap, Chepkoech struggled and fell off the back. About the same time, Frerichs broke off the front, only Chemutai gave chase. Coming off the water jump with a little more than two laps to go, Frerichs accelerated again, losing Chemutai up to 15 metres behind. After the next water jump, with a little over a lap to go, Chemutai sped up to pull in the gap. She went by Frerichs with authority at the beginning of the backstretch. Frerichs accelerated again to keep contact with Chemutai. Chemutai took the final water jump cleanly, Frerichs got hung up in the water and the break was made. 
Chemutai cruised home with a 20 metre margin, holding up her number one finger to celebrate Uganda's first victory in the Steeplechase and the first Ugandan woman to take gold. Frerichs lost her momentum and struggled home the final straightaway but still had enough of a margin on a fast closing Kiyeng to take silver.",465

Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's marathon,Qualification,"This was the 10th appearance of the event, having appeared at every Olympics since 1984. Eighty-eight athletes competed.
A National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to three athletes in the women's marathon if all athletes met the entry standard or qualify by ranking during the qualifying period (the qualification period for ""Entry Standard"" (2:29:30) was from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2021, with a maximum quota per NOC of 3.). The limit of 3 has been in place since the 1930 Olympic Congress.
The standard was ""set for the sole purpose of qualifying athletes with exceptional performances unable to qualify through the IAAF World Rankings pathway."" Runners in the top 10 at the 2019 world championship, the top 5 at any IAAF Gold Label marathon, and the top 10 at the Marathon Major Series were deemed to have met the qualifying standard, regardless of actual time. The world rankings, based on the average of the best five results for the athlete over the qualifying period and weighted by the importance of the meet, will then be used to qualify athletes until the cap of 80 is reached. More than 80 athletes (after application of the 3 per NOC rule) have met the qualifying standard.
To be a qualifying performance, the course had to have been certified in the last five years by a Grade A or Grade B road course measurer. In order to be eligible for the qualifying standard time, the elevation decrease could not be more than 1 metre per kilometre. For world rankings, the elevation decrease could exceed that rate, but a correction would be made to the score.The qualifying period was originally from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2020.

15 men qualified through a tough round of heats. On home soil, Ryuji Miura set the Japanese National Record. A slow third heat left, among others, one Kenyan and one Ethiopian runner to watch the final from the stands.
True to form in most championships, the final started slowly with Ethiopians Girma and Getnet Wale controlling the pace from the front. About 1K in, Miura injected a little more speed, but the Ethiopians went back to the point, marked by the Kenyan duo of Abraham Kibiwott and Benjamin Kigen along with Kenyan born American Benard Keter. As they approached 3 laps to go, Girma made an effort to speed up the race, the field stringing out behind them, with only the two Ethiopians, the two Kenyans breaking away with Soufiane El Bakkali going on the back of the leaders for the ride. Through the penultimate lap, both Kenyans showed signs of weakness, losing contact on the remaining three at the bell. Duplicating the strategy of Ezekiel Kemboi, El Bakkali accelerated over the first barrier of the backstretch. Wale struggled to keep up and Kigen sprinting to regain contact as his country's last hope. Entering the final turn, El Bakkali caught Girma. With both athletes taking the water jump cleanly, behind them as Kigen was catching Wale, his lead foot caught Wale's back kick and Wale was down. Kigen quickly regained his balance while Wale lost all momentum and his chance at a medal.

This was the first time in Olympic history the flag was passed from between two female mayors.The Paris 2024 presentation was two pre-recorded short films, transitioning to around 2 minutes of live footage of a special celebration welcoming the Olympics home to the birthplace of Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the Olympic Movement, in front of the iconic Eiffel Tower at the Trocadéro, Paris, (which will serve as the main venue during the 2024 games). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions, this was done in accordance with the safety measures as performers from the next host city could not travel to Tokyo. It was allowed as part of an Agenda 2020 plan implemented by the IOC in 2014. 
The first short film presented a contemporary arrangement by Victor le Masne of the National Anthem of France performed by the Orchestre National de France, led by the conductor Chloé Dufresne. The anthem was also performed by musicians at many known places across Paris such as the roof of Stade de France (which will host athletics, football and rugby 7's), inside the Louvre museum, the Square du Vert-Galant, La Recyclerie and the Skatepark Diderot. After the orchestra's performance, European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet played the last few notes of the anthem on his saxophone from the International Space Station, as it was flying over Japan.
The second short film was called ""Ride"", directed by Valentin Petit and featured music by Woodkid, starting with footage of the city of Paris seen from space. This act features young BMX star Estelle Majal incarnating Marianne (the symbol of the French Republic or one of the three symbols on the Paris 2024 emblem logo). She presented the concept of the world-renowned ceilings of Paris and rides her bike across the roof from many famous landmarks in Paris such as the Palais-Royal, the Musée d'Orsay, the Palais Garnier and Le Panthéon, before ending with a shot of the Eiffel Tower with a digital giant flag featuring the Paris 2024 emblem flying on it. The real flag was initially planned to be raised live which would have broken a world record for the largest flag ever flown, but due to bad weather conditions in Paris, instead they used a CGI animation of the flag, as the flag used during the trial held on 8 June was different in design and was smallest and contained parts that was used at the bigger flag.After the film, French Olympic athletes who returned from Tokyo after their competitions were held in the first week of the Games appeared, such as judokas Clarisse Agbegnenou and Teddy Riner with medals, who have returned from Tokyo was on an open-air party with 6000 people watching the closing ceremony at the Trocadéro in celebrating the handover from Tokyo to Paris and the Olympics' return to Paris as the Patrouille de France flies over the Eiffel Tower, with smoke in the national colours of blue, white and red streaming across the Parisian skies, while young performers take the stage performing breakdancing, the newest sport on the Paris Olympic programme. Finally, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared from the top of the Eiffel Tower with some young athletes and delivered the French version of the new Olympic Motto, ""Plus vite, Plus haut, Plus fort – Ensemble"" (""Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together"") ending the Paris 2024 segment.After Macron's appearance, the president of the COJOP, Tony Estanguet (who has also just returned from Tokyo some hours before) appears on stage and writes ""Paris 2024"" on a camera lens as the camera moves up to the blue skies of summer in Paris just like what happens in tennis Grand Slams. The image is shown on the stadium screens whilst the Tokyo Skytree is shown in the national colours of France, showing a connection between two iconic symbols of the current and future host cities, Tokyo's Skytree and Paris' Eiffel Tower.Local rights owners for the next Games (Discovery, Inc. under Eurosport and France Télévisions) were mainly involved for the Paris 2024 presentation as they handled most of the filming process for the presentation, and was broadcast by satellite (CEST: UTC+2 14:42-14:53). This was the first (and only) time in Olympic history that a handover presentation at the closing ceremony was 100% produced, performed and broadcast outside the current host city.",1056
2020 Summer Olympics closing ceremony,Passing the Baton,"Seiko Hashimoto, President of the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games spoke to the athletes ""There are no words to describe what you have achieved."" ""Tonight the Olympic Flame that has lit up Tokyo will quietly go out. But the hope that has been ignited here will never be extinguished. It will remain alight in the hearts of people all over the world as we continue to hope for peace in the spirit of Ekecheiria, a tradition unbroken from the ancient Olympic Games."" She also pointed people to the upcoming Paralympic Games. Her comments were overshadowed by a moth that landed on the podium.IOC President Thomas Bach thanked the volunteers for an ""unprecedented Olympic Games"" and said that Japanese people can be ""extremely proud of what you have achieved"". In French, he declared the Games closed, calling them ""the Games of hope, solidarity, and peace"", and ""call[ed] upon the youth of the world"" to assemble in Paris for the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad in 2024.",219
2020 Summer Olympics closing ceremony,On to the Next Chapter,"After the presentation and closing speeches, actress Shinobu Otake (with the Suginami Children's Chorus) appeared, simulating an astronomy class in allusion to sci-fi movies and comics as they sang the iconic and popular song, ""A Stroll Among Stars"" composed by Kenji Miyazawa. The lyrics highlights the constellations that are seen in the Japanese sky during summer nights. After the song ended, an electronic version of Claude Debussy's Clair de lune performed by Isao Tomita started playing, the cauldron's flame was extinguished through a ""telekinesis simulation"" (the cauldron was simulated to have been extinguished manually as it was impossible to do so in real life) in which the children and the teacher were making a sign of gratitude, shortly thereafter, the structure in which the fire had been burning for the past 16 days closed and reverted to its original shape. As the protocol demands, the last fireworks display then started.
After the fireworks display a trailer of the then upcoming Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games was screened. Finally, one of the large screens showed a goodbye message with the word ""Arigato"" which is shown in the same font as the word ""Sayonara"" was during the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games Tokyo 1964 using stop-motion toy cubes rather than scoreboard lettering. This was a homage and a gratitude to all the people who were involved in the two times the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games (1964 and 2020).",311

2020 Summer Olympics closing ceremony,Reviews,"Philip Barker of Inside the Games opined that for many athletes and supporters, the tone of the ceremony was dignified and appropriate. Hashimoto stated in a press interview that the flame would ""quietly go out"", which he felt that ""It was an apt description of a dignified and low key Ceremony which conveyed a sense of gratitude that the Games had been able to take place at all.""Dominic Patten of Deadline Hollywood argued that the ceremony was an ""uneven mixtape"" of contrasts, comparing the low-key ""celebration of the culture of the Asian power and brow moping acknowledgement of the pandemic"" to the jubilant Paris segment, as well as cliché-filled speech of Thomas Bach.Alan Tyres of The Daily Telegraph discussed the IOC updated motto as a sign of things to come. He stated, ""The updated Olympic motto of 'faster, higher, stronger – together' fits with how sport is covered and contextualised at this moment in history: inclusion, diversity, justice and a duty of care to the athletes must be taken into consideration as much as performance."" He also discussed the strangeness of the ceremony, as it was performed without a stadium audience.",247
2020 Summer Olympics cauldron,Summary,"The 2020 Summer Olympics cauldron was made for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. In fact, there were two cauldrons, one in the Olympic Stadium for ceremonial use (opening and closing ceremony only) and another on Tokyo's new waterfront on Ariake West Canal, which was lit after the Opening Ceremony and remained alight throughout the Games. The cauldron was designed by Canadian-Japanese designer Oki Sato, who attended Waseda University, the same university as Yoshinori Sakai, the cauldron-lighter in 1964. The steps to reach the cauldron, symbolising Mount Fuji, were ""designed to evoke the image of a blooming sakura flower.""Designed by Nendo founder Oki Sato, the white cauldron evokes the opening ceremony's concept of ""All gather under the sun, all are equal, and all receive energy"". The panels opened to reveal the Olympic torch, at the ending of the opening ceremony, and was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka. ""At the end of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, the cauldron 'blooms' to welcome the final torchbearer,"" said Nendo. ""This expresses not only the sun itself, but also the energy and vitality that can be obtained from it, such as plants sprouting, flowers blooming, and hands opening wide toward the sky.""The cauldron's flame was the first at the Olympics to burn hydrogen as a fuel. The hydrogen was produced via the electrolysis of water using solar power produced at a plant in the Fukushima Prefecture. Hydrogen produced by this process is known as green hydrogen. The hydrogen burns with an invisible, colourless flame unlike propane, which has is traditionally used as a fuel in previous Olympic flames. In order to create a yellow and visible flame, sodium carbonate is sprayed. ""[We] adjusted the movement and shape of the flame to shimmer like firewood was stoked; such an attempt to 'design flames' was unprecedented."" said Nendo firm.
After the 2020 Summer Olympics the waterfront cauldron has remained in place as a reminder of the Games, as in 2016.",440

Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's rhythmic individual all-around,Controversy in Russia,"The final result of the competition was considered controversial in Russia, as Israeli gold medalist Linoy Ashram dropped her apparatus during her ribbon routine. The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) claims that she didn't receive a significant deduction (despite the fact that she did get a 0.700 deduction), which would have otherwise changed the standing due to the narrow score difference between Ashram and Russian silver medalist Dina Averina. Meanwhile, Olympic judges and supporters of Ashram note that Ashram's combined overall difficulty was over a point (+1.000) higher than Averina, allowing Ashram to score well even had she received a 1.000 point deduction for dropping the apparatus.After the results were in, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) coaches submitted an inquiry on Dina Averina's ribbon score, but the score was left unchanged. Averina commented that she believed the judges were supporting Ashram and punishing herself, and she considers herself the champion. This position was universally supported by the Russian state-controlled media, which stated that Averina was the victim of ""political games"" and was purposefully denied gold, referring to it as ""the conspiracy against Russia"".
Their claims were dismissed by the international governing body, the FIG (International Gymnastics Federation), which confirmed that the FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee carried out a post-competition review of all evaluation components in every phase of the rhythmic gymnastics competition at Tokyo 2020. They stated:""Following this process, we can confirm that no bias or irregularities were identified in the judging panels. The Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee, therefore, confirms that the rankings and results of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games competitions in rhythmic gymnastics for both individuals and groups are fair and impartial.

He failed to do the same for the other apparatuses, including the floor exercise. In the floor exercise he failed to execute a landing in the early part of his routine. His second landing was self-described as ""not good either"". Yulo insisted that he was not affected by pressure or nervousness during his floor exercise performance and dismissed reports that he was nursing an injury, which he said he had sustained over three months ago. Yulo's coach Munehiro Kugiyama took responsibility for Yulo's failure to advance to the floor exercise finals.Yulo did not expect to qualify for the vault finals, admitting he was surprised with his performance in that apparatus' qualifiers. He has tempered expectations that he would medal in vault but has pledged to improve his previous score. Yulo finished fourth in the vault finals.

Approximately 30 shooters from 20 nations are expected to compete in the rapid fire pistol, with the precise number depending on how many shooters compete in multiple events.",65
Shooting at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol,Background,"This will be the 26th of what has been standardised in 1948 as the men's ISSF 25 meter rapid fire pistol event, the only event on the 2020 programme that traces back to 1896. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1928 (when no shooting events were held) and 1908; it was nominally open to women from 1968 to 1980, although very few women participated these years. The first five events were quite different, with some level of consistency finally beginning with the 1932 event—which, though it had differences from the 1924 competition, was roughly similar. The 1936 competition followed the 1932 one quite closely. The post-World War II event substantially altered the competition once again. The 1984 Games introduced women's-only shooting events, including the ISSF 25 meter pistol (though this is more similar to the non-Olympic men's ISSF 25 meter center-fire pistol than the rapid fire pistol).
Of the six finalists from 2016, one has been announced as a returning competitor. Jean Quiquampoix of France earned a qualifying spot at the 2018 World Championships and has been selected by his NOC. Three other 2016 finalists (gold medalist Christian Reitz of Germany, fifth-place finisher Leuris Pupo of Cuba, and sixth-place finisher Riccardo Mazzetti of Italy) have earned quota spots but their NOCs have not announced selections yet. The remaining two (bronze medalist Li Yuehong and fourth-place finisher Zhang Fusheng of China) saw other shooters from their NOC earn spots; the NOC has not announced its selections yet.
The United States has earned a qualifying spot and is expected to make its 22nd appearance, most of any nation.",364
Shooting at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol,Qualification,"Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter up to two shooters if the NOC earns enough quota sports or has enough double starter-qualified shooters. To compete, a shooter needs a quota spot and to achieve a Minimum Qualification Score (MQS). Once a shooter is using a quota spot in any shooting event, they can enter any other shooting event for which they have achieved the MQS as well (a double starter qualification). There are 29 quota spots available for the rapid fire pistol (significantly increased since the elimination of the 50 metre pistol after 2016). They are: 4 for the 2018 World Championships, 8 for 2019 World Cup events, 13 from continental events (4 each from Asia and Europe, 3 from the Americas, and 1 each from Africa and Oceania), 1 for the host nation (Japan), 2 from Tripartite Commission invitations, and 1 from world ranking. 
The MQS for the men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol for 2020 is 560.The COVID-19 pandemic delayed some of the events for qualifying for shooting, though many had been complete before the effects were felt.",232
Shooting at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol,Competition format,"The competition format will continue to use the two-round (qualifying round and final) format, as in 1988 and since 1996, with the final format introduced in 2012. The 2005 rules changes required the pistols used to be sport pistols, banning .22 Short cartridges.
The qualifying round from 1988 onward was essentially the same as the full competition format from 1948 to 1984. Each shooter fired 60 shots. These were done in two courses of 30; each course consisted of two stages of 15; each stage consisted of three series of 5. In each stage, the time limit for each series was 8 seconds for the first, 6 seconds for the second, and 4 seconds for the third. 
The 1988 tournament had added a two-series final for the top eight shooters; the 1992 competition broke that down to a four-series semifinal for the top eight and two-series final for the top four. In 1996 and 2000, the top eight once again advanced to the final. The 2004 version had reduced the number of finalists to six, where it stayed in 2008 and 2012.
Prior to 2008, the final involved two series of 5 shots at 4 seconds. In 2008, that was expanded to four series. The 2012 competition used an entirely different format, however, which remained in effect in 2016 and 2020. The competition switched to a ""hit-or-miss"" system, where a 9.7 or better scores as a ""hit"" for 1 point and anything lower scores as a ""miss"" for 0 points. The final featured 8 series of 5 shots each (5 points maximum per series, 40 points maximum total). However, starting with the fourth series, the remaining shooter with the lowest total was eliminated after each series (5 shooters remaining in the fifth series, 4 in the sixth, 3 in the seventh, and only 2 in the eighth and final series).
The 1992 competition had introduced round targets rather than the silhouettes used from 1948 to 1988 as well as many pre-World War II versions of the event. Score, rather than hits, had been used as the primary ranking method since 1960.",430

Shooting at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Competition format,"On 9 June 2017, the International Shooting Sport Federation welcomed the decision of the International Olympic Committee to approve the changes of the Olympic shooting program to achieve gender equality and to enhance the sport's popularity and worldwide appeal. One of the significant changes in the program was to replace the three men-only events, namely 50 m rifle prone, 50 m pistol, and double trap, with the mixed team competitions (rifle, pistol, and trap), which were highly encouraged as a means of ensuring gender equality. Other ratified changes included the same number of shots for both men and women, and the progressive elimination finals for both the women's sport pistol and the shotgun events.Similar to 2016 format, all shooters advanced to the Olympic finals of their individual events must start from scratch and compete against each other in a series of elimination rounds. The stage continues until the competition leaves with only two shooters battling out in a duel to decide the gold and silver medals.",191
Shooting at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Qualification,"In February 2018, the International Shooting Sport Federation has agreed to change the rules on the allocation of the Olympic quota places, as it aims to attain gender equality.

There, forty-eight individual and twelve mixed team quota places will be assigned. Throughout the process, quota places will be generally awarded when a shooter earns a gold medal in an ISSF World Cup series or posts a top finish at the ISSF World Championships or the continental championships (Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas).
After the qualification period concludes and all NOCs receive the official list of quota places, the ISSF will check the World Ranking list in each of the individual shooting events. The highest-ranked shooter, who has not qualified in any event and whose NOC does not have a berth in a specific event, will obtain a direct Olympic quota place.Unlike the previous Games, host nation Japan is guaranteed twelve quota places, with one in each of the individual shooting events.",279

Australia had hoped to have both Martin and Loupos compete. The final rankings, however, put the United States as the #1-ranked nation. This meant that the United States was the only nation able to send two cyclists in the event; Australia, as the #2-ranked nation, could send only one. Further, Loupos was seriously injured during the 2021 World Championship less than two months before the Games, which would have kept him from competing in any case.

Instead, look for someone like Roglič, Froome, or Rohan Dennis – two-time world champ in the time trial and an Olympic track silver medallist – to come to the fore. Young hotshot Remco Evenepoel of Belgium and Rio silver medallist Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands – if he decides to return from his indefinite break – could also feature in the conversation.

There was an extra requirement that each continent should have at least two teams. This was not the case for Asia, which had only one. Thus, a spot was given to its second-ranked nation, Iran, at the expense of 30th-ranked Latvia. Because qualification was completed by 22 October 2019, it was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
One additional place was added for Refugee Olympic Team member Ahmad Wais.

Afterwards, the riders gradually climbed for 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) towards the first intermediate time check. The riders then began another descent towards the second time check, looping back towards the entrance of the Speedway. After passing through the entrance, the riders tackled a 1.4-kilometre (0.87 mi) climb before going inside the Speedway proper. The riders rode through the Speedway before the lap ended on the finish line. The men rode this circuit twice for a total distance of 44.2 kilometres (27.5 mi). The elevation gain was approximately 846 metres (2,776 ft).",209
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's road time trial,Race overview,"The time trial commenced at 14:00 Japan Standard Time (UTC+9) with Ahmad Wais (Refugee Olympic Team) the first rider off the start ramp. The first rider to set a fast time was Hugo Houle (Canada), with a time of 57:56.46. Stefan de Bod (South Africa) threatened his time but he eventually fell short by less than a second. No other rider in the first group threatened his time as Houle stayed in the hot seat until the next group of riders took to the course.
As the second group of riders started their rides, three riders challenged Houle's time: Remco Evenepoel (Belgium), Alberto Bettiol (Italy), and Rigoberto Urán (Colombia). At the first time check, Evenepoel was six seconds off Houle's time while Urán was 16 seconds down. Bettiol soon set the fastest time at the first time check, five seconds ahead of Houle. At the end of the first lap, Evenepoel and Urán were four and five seconds down on Houle, respectively. Meanwhile, Bettiol faded towards the end of the first lap, finishing the lap with a deficit of 21 seconds. All three riders began to edge ahead of Houle as they rode through the second lap. Evenepoel was the first rider to knock Houle off the top spot, finishing 35 seconds faster. Bettiol was almost 17 seconds slower than Evenepoel at the finish before Urán pushed Evenepoel into provisional second, finishing around two and a half seconds faster than the Belgian.
The final group of riders soon took to the course. The first rider to threaten Urán's time was Tom Dumoulin (Netherlands). Dumoulin was around 16 seconds faster than Bettiol's time at the first time check before his time was beaten by Primož Roglič (Slovenia), who was two and a half seconds faster. Rohan Dennis (Australia), Stefan Küng (Switzerland), and Wout van Aert (Belgium) were less than 10 seconds behind Roglič's time at the first time check before the world champion, Filippo Ganna (Italy), was half a second faster than Roglič. As the riders finished the first lap, Roglič ended up taking the top spot, with no other rider within eight seconds of his time. In the second lap, Roglič gradually built his advantage as he maintained his pace while the other riders began to fade. The battle for the silver and bronze medals also intensified as Dumoulin, Dennis, Küng, and Ganna were within five seconds of each other for most of the time. Kasper Asgreen (Denmark) and van Aert also faded in the second lap, losing considerable time. At the finish, Dumoulin was the first rider to knock Urán off the top spot, finishing more than a minute ahead. However, Roglič immediately beat Dumoulin's time as he finished with a time of 55:04.19, more than a minute ahead of Dumoulin. No one would threaten Roglič's time as he took the gold medal. Dennis came close to beating Dumoulin but he fell short by two and a half seconds to go into provisional third. Küng was also challenging the times of Dumoulin and Dennis before finishing at less than half a second from Dennis's time. The last rider to finish was Ganna. He eventually came in at almost two seconds down on Dennis, finishing without a medal. Thus, the silver medal went to Dumoulin while the bronze medal went to Dennis.",763

She won by 1' 15"" over the silver medalist, Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands.
Van Vleuten made a late attack with 2.1 kilometres (1.3 mi) to go, distancing the remnants of the peloton. She celebrated after crossing the line, having mistakenly thought that all the breakaway riders had been caught and that she had won gold. The bronze medal went to Elisa Longo Borghini of Italy, after unsuccessfully attempting to bridge up to van Vleuten's attack and holding off the peloton.Kiesenhofer's win was considered a huge upset; she had trained for the event without a coach or a professional team, and was not viewed as a contender to win a medal. Her solo victory was described as one of the biggest upsets in Olympics history.",325
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race,Qualification,"A National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to four qualified cyclists in the women's individual road race. All quota places are assigned to the NOC, which may select the cyclists that compete. There were 67 total quota spots available for the race. The assignments of spots to NOCs was a multi-stage process:

First, 62 places were assigned through the UCI world ranking by nations. This ranking included Elite and U-23 women's races for the 2019 season (22 October 2018 to 22 October 2019). The top five nations each received the maximum of four quota places: the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, the United States, and Australia. Nations ranked 6th through 13th each received three quota places, and 14th through 22nd each received two quota places.
Next, a special rule provided an opportunity for individuals ranked in the top 100 but whose nation was not in the top 22 to earn places (which would replace the lowest ranked nations). There were 17 eligible individuals. Their places were deducted from the lower-ranked nations: this reduced all of the 14th–22th nations to one quota place each and all of the 6th–13th nations to two places each.
Three more quota places were assigned through the 2019 African, Asian, and Pan-American championships; at each championship, among nations that were not yet qualified, the one with the highest placed road race cyclist earned a spot; these were taken by Ethiopia, South Korea, and Paraguay, respectively.
The final two quota places were reserved for the host nation; if the host nation had already earned one or two places, they would be reallocated through the UCI world rankings. In this case, Japan had earned one quota place through standard qualification, and so they received only one additional place, whereas the other was recovered by sixth-ranked Belgium. Because qualification was complete by 22 October 2019, this allocation was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shortly before the start of the games, Finnish cyclist Lotta Henttala withdrew from the race. She was replaced by Alison Jackson from eighth-ranked Canada. Likewise, Swedish competitor Emilia Fahlin withdrew and was replaced by Marta Lach from ninth-ranked Poland.",459
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race,Competition format and course,"The road race was a mass-start, one-day road race event. The courses for the men's and women's road races were revealed in August 2018. The women's race started at Musashinonomori Park in Chōfu, western Tokyo, at 13:00 Japan Standard Time (UTC+9) and finished at the Fuji Speedway circuit in the Shizuoka prefecture. The women's road race was 137 kilometres (85 mi) long with a total elevation gain of 2,692 metres (8,832 ft).The first part of the men's and women's races were identical. The course first passed through the mostly flat outskirts of Tokyo's metropolitan area. After 40 kilometres (25 mi), the riders gradually climbed towards the foot of the climb to Doushi Road, a 5.9-kilometre (3.7 mi) climb with an average gradient of 5.7 percent. The climb topped out after 80 kilometres (50 mi) of racing at an altitude of 1,121 metres (3,678 ft) above sea level. After reaching Lake Yamanakako in Yamanashi and crossing the Kagosaka Pass, the riders faced a 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) descent and from here, the courses were different for the men's and women's races. Following the descent, the women's race made their way towards the Fuji Speedway circuit, bypassing the climbs of Fuji Sanroku and the Mikuni Pass. The riders contested one and a half laps of the undulating track before crowning the winner at the Fuji Speedway.",330
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race,Race overview,"As soon as the racing started, Anna Kiesenhofer (Austria) attacked from the peloton. She was soon joined by Carla Oberholzer (South Africa), Vera Looser (Namibia), Omer Shapira (Israel), and Anna Plichta (Poland). Several riders attempted to bridge to the front but they were caught by the peloton. The break was considered unthreatening, and was allowed to build a maximum advantage of around 11 minutes over the favourites before the gap was stabilized. As the road began to go uphill, Looser struggled to follow the pace in the break and she began to drop back. With 88 kilometres (55 mi) to go, Oberholzer also lost contact with her breakaway companions as three riders were left at the front. The trio up front managed to maintain their gap over the peloton as no teams were willing to take up the chase behind, leaning on the extremely strong Netherlands team who likewise failed to pursue. As the peloton neared the foot of the climb to Doushi Road, Emma Norsgaard Jørgensen (Denmark)'s wheel aligned with an expansion joint in the road causing her to lose control and crash. Annemiek van Vleuten (Netherlands) could not evade the fallen rider and went head over, both bicycles becoming entangled.  Both riders eventually got back up.
With around 61 kilometres (38 mi) to go, Demi Vollering (Netherlands) attacked from the peloton, sparking a flurry of attacks. However, all the moves were eventually covered while the break still enjoyed a lead of around eight and a half minutes. On the climb to Doushi Road, the lead began to come down as the pace in the peloton started to shed riders out the back. Around 51 kilometres (32 mi) from the finish, van Vleuten made another attack, this time building a gap over the peloton. At this point, the gap to the break up front still stood at around five and a half minutes. Van Vleuten managed to increase her lead to a minute over the peloton while up front, on the Kagosaka Pass, Kiesenhofer dropped Shapira and Plichta, going solo with 41 kilometres (25 mi) still left to race. Kiesenhofer maintained her five-minute advantage over van Vleuten on the descent from the Kagosaka Pass while the peloton was a further minute in arrears. As Kiesenhofer ended the descent, she still held a lead of four and a half minutes over the peloton. A few moments later, Juliette Labous (France) attacked from the peloton and gained a lead of around 20 seconds.
Kiesenhofer soon passed through the finish line at the Fuji Speedway for the first time with 17 kilometres (11 mi) to go, holding a lead of two minutes over Shapira and Plichta, almost four minutes over Labous, and more than four minutes over the peloton. At this point, Netherlands began to set a faster pace, bringing back Labous and closing in on Shapira and Plichta. With 4.5 kilometres (2.8 mi) left, both Shapira and Plichta were finally caught by the peloton; at this point, some of the riders, not having radios as is common in road cycling outside the Olympics, thought that all the breakaway riders had been caught, when in reality Kiesenhofer was still leading by three minutes. 2.1 kilometres (1.3 mi) from the finish, van Vleuten attacked from the peloton, with Elisa Longo Borghini (Italy) going after her. However, van Vleuten continued to maintain her gap over Longo Borghini while up front, but not catching the lone leader. Kiesenhofer soloed to the biggest win of her career, winning the gold medal.
Van Vleuten went on to take the silver medal. She celebrated as she crossed the line, thinking that she won the gold medal. There was controversy afterward because during the race, without radio communication, the organisation had not informed riders properly that Kiesenhofer was in the lead, or by how far. Longo Borghini held on to take the bronze medal.",888

Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race,Summary,"The men's individual road race event at the 2020 Summer Olympics took place on 24 July 2021 on a course starting at Musashinonomori Park in Tokyo, and ending at the Fuji Speedway in Shizuoka Prefecture. 128 cyclists from 57 nations competed, with 85 completing the course.
The race was won by Richard Carapaz of Ecuador. Carapaz, along with Brandon McNulty of the United States, attacked with 25 kilometres (16 mi) to go and immediately built a gap over the chasing group. Both riders worked together until Carapaz dropped McNulty with 5.8 kilometres (3.6 mi) to go. Carapaz held off the chase group to win the race by more than a minute. The silver and bronze medals went to Wout van Aert of Belgium and Tadej Pogačar of Slovenia, respectively. Both riders were part of the 11-man chase group that rode in pursuit of Carapaz and McNulty. Eight of the 11 riders contested the sprint for the silver medal, with van Aert holding off Pogačar to take second.",229
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race,Background,"This was the 21st appearance of the event, initially held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932; the time trial was re-introduced in 1996 alongside the road race. Burkina Faso and Panama made their debut in the men's individual road race.",74
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race,Qualification,"A National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to five qualified cyclists in the men's individual road race. All quota places are assigned to the NOC, which may select the cyclists that compete. There were 130 total quota spots available for the race, which were allocated in a multi-step process:
122 spots were assigned through the UCI world ranking by nations. This ranking included Elite and U-23 men's races for the 2019 season (22 October 2018 to 22 October 2019). The top six nations each received the maximum of five quota places: Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Colombia, and Spain. Nations ranked 7th through 13th each received four quota places, 14th through 21st each received three quota places, 22nd through 32nd each received two quota places, and 33rd through 50th each received one quota place.
A special rule provided an opportunity for individuals ranked in the top 200 but whose nation was not in the top 50 to earn places (which would replace the lowest ranked nations), but there were no eligible individuals.
The next six quota places were assigned through the 2019 African, Asian, and Pan-American championships; at each championship, among the nations not yet qualified, the two nations with the highest-placed road race cyclist earned spots. These were taken by Burkina Faso and Namibia in Africa, Chinese Taipei and Uzbekistan in Asia, and Peru and Panama in the Americas.
The final two quota places were reserved for the host nation; if the host nation had already earned one or two places, they would be reallocated through the UCI world rankings. In this case, Japan had earned one quota place through standard qualification, and so they received only one of the host places, while the other was reallocated to 51st-ranked Hong Kong. Because this allocation was complete by 22 October 2019, it was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shortly before the games, Sweden withdrew their athlete, who was replaced with Josip Rumac from 52nd-ranked Croatia.
On 18 July, Daniel Martínez from Colombia could not travel to Tokyo after continuing to test positive for COVID-19. On 23 July, Rohan Dennis of Australia decided to skip the road race to focus on the individual time trial. These riders were removed from the start list and were not replaced.Finally, both Simon Geschke of Germany and Michal Schlegel of the Czech Republic did not start the race after testing positive for COVID-19 the day before the race.",524
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race,Competition format and course,"The road race was a mass-start, one-day road race event. The courses for the men's and women's road races were revealed in August 2018. The men's race started at Musashinonomori Park in Chōfu, western Tokyo, at 11:00 Japan Standard Time (UTC+9) and finished at the Fuji Speedway circuit in the Shizuoka prefecture. The race was 234 kilometres (145 mi) long with a total elevation gain of 4,865 metres (15,961 ft).The first part of the men's and women's races were identical. The course first passed through the mostly flat outskirts of Tokyo's metropolitan area. After 40 kilometres (25 mi), the riders gradually climbed towards the foot of the climb to Doushi Road, a 5.9-kilometre (3.7 mi) climb with an average gradient of 5.7 percent. The climb topped out after 80 kilometres (50 mi) of racing at an altitude of 1,121 metres (3,678 ft) above sea level. After reaching Lake Yamanakako in Yamanashi and crossing the Kagosaka Pass, the riders faced a 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) descent and from here, the courses were different for the men's and women's races.
After the descent, the men's race headed towards the lower slopes of Mount Fuji, Japan's highest mountain, where they went up the 14.3-kilometre (8.9 mi) long climb of Fuji Sanroku with an average incline of six percent. The climb was crested with 96.5 kilometres (60.0 mi) left at an elevation of 1,451 metres (4,760 ft) before the riders faced a 15.5-kilometre (9.6 mi) long descent into Gotemba. Afterwards, the riders headed towards the Fuji Speedway section, where they crossed the finish line twice before reaching the foot of the Mikuni Pass. The climb was 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) long with an average gradient of 10.6 percent and included sections reaching 20 percent. It was expected to be the decisive climb in the race. The peak, at an altitude of 1,171 metres (3,842 ft), was crested with about 33 kilometres (21 mi) to go. After the climb, the race returned to Lake Yamanakako and the Kagosaka Pass before a final descent and a short hilly section towards the finish on the Fuji Speedway circuit.",526
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race,Race overview,"As soon as the race started, a group of eight riders broke away from the peloton. The group comprised Nicholas Dlamini (South Africa), Michael Kukrle (Czech Republic), Juraj Sagan (Slovakia), Polychronis Tzortzakis (Greece), Eduard-Michael Grosu (Romania), Orluis Aular (Venezuela), Paul Daumont (Burkina Faso), and Elchin Asadov (Azerbaijan). The break reached a maximum advantage of around 19 minutes before the peloton began its pursuit, with defending Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet (Belgium) and Jan Tratnik (Slovenia), in particular, leading the chase. On the gradual uphill section ahead of the climb to Doushi Road, Tristan de Lange (Namibia) attacked from the peloton but he was eventually caught. With around 150 kilometres (93 mi) to go, a crash took place in the peloton, taking down the Great Britain duo of Geraint Thomas and Tao Geoghegan Hart as well as Giulio Ciccone (Italy) and Gregor Mühlberger (Austria). All riders eventually managed to get back up and return to the peloton. Up front, the break was reduced to five riders – Aular, Dlamini, Tzortzakis, Kukrle, and Sagan – after the first climb. The group led the peloton by around 16 minutes.
As the race reached the foot of Fuji Sanroku, Van Avermaet and Tratnik continued to lead the chase as the break started the climb with a lead of around 13 and a half minutes. Patrick Bevin (New Zealand) went to the front to help with the chase and the break's lead gradually decreased as the climb went on while further up the ascent, Van Avermaet began to get dropped along with several other riders. Near the top, Ciccone took over at the front of the peloton to set a faster tempo. Some of the notable riders to struggle on the climb include the Spanish duo of Omar Fraile and Alejandro Valverde. The break reached the top of Fuji Sanroku with a lead of almost six minutes. Tratnik soon made his way back to the front of the peloton to gradually eat into the break's advantage, with the break reaching the Fuji Speedway with a lead of around four minutes. At the start of the circuit, several riders began to abandon the race, most notably Thomas, Van Avermaet and Fraile.
After the first passage through the finish line, attacks lit up the peloton as Damiano Caruso (Italy), Wilco Kelderman (Netherlands), and Mauri Vansevenant (Belgium) rode away. After the three riders were caught, Remco Evenepoel (Belgium) instigated another attack and brought Vincenzo Nibali (Italy) and Eddie Dunbar (Ireland) with him. Meanwhile, up front, the break began to splinter as Sagan and Dlamini couldn't continue with the quick pace and the peloton edged closer to them. The trio of Evenepoel, Nibali, and Dunbar was soon brought back. As the race reached the Fuji Speedway for the second time, the remnants of the original break were finally caught, with the peloton setting themselves up for the decisive climb of the race, the Mikuni Pass.
As the peloton reached the foot of the Mikuni Pass, Italy stationed themselves up front before Tiesj Benoot (Belgium) began to set a furious pace. After Benoot's work was done, his compatriot Vansevenant continued to set a fast tempo as the peloton continued to thin out. With around 37.4 kilometres (23.2 mi) to go, Tadej Pogačar (Slovenia) put in a seated acceleration. Brandon McNulty (United States) and Michael Woods (Canada) followed his move while Wout van Aert (Belgium) led the chase group. The trio led by around 20 seconds before riders began to bridge up front. Near the top, the front group struggled with cooperation as the group including van Aert managed to make it across. As the group made its way back to Lake Yamanakako and the Kagosaka Pass, several riders attacked off the front. Bauke Mollema (Netherlands) and Jakob Fuglsang (Denmark) tried to initiate some attacks but the moves were brought back.
With 25 kilometres (16 mi) to go, Brandon McNulty accelerated off the front with Richard Carapaz (Ecuador) responding to the move. The duo began to increase their advantage as the chase group suffered from a lack of cooperation, with van Aert leading much of the chase. The duo's advantage reached more than 40 seconds before van Aert produced a searing acceleration on a short uphill rise with around 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) to go. The lead was soon down to 13 seconds with 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) to go. With 5.8 kilometres (3.6 mi) left, Carapaz dropped McNulty to solo off the front. After McNulty was caught by the chase group, the riders continued to attack each other, allowing Carapaz to increase his lead once again. Carapaz would not be caught as he won the gold medal, his country's second in history. With gold already taken, the chase group set themselves up for the sprint for the silver and bronze medals, resulting in an 8-way race for the finish in the final metres of the race, which was initiated by Adam Yates (Great Britain). Van Aert and Pogačar prevailed in the sprint, taking silver and bronze respectively. The gap between second and ninth places was within a single second.",1226

Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics,Summary,"Beach volleyball was introduced at the Summer Olympic Games in the 1992 Games as a demonstration event, and has been an official Olympic sport since  1996. The United States is the only country to win medals in every edition, followed by Brazil, who had their medal streak broken in the 2020 tournament.
Winning the Olympics is considered to be the highest honor in international beach volleyball, followed by the World Championships, and the World Tour of the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) for men and women.",107
Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics,Origins,"Beach volleyball was a demonstration sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, at which Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos won the men's tournament, and Karolyn Kirby and Nancy Reno won the women's.
Beach volleyball was introduced as an official Olympic sport in 1996. A total of 24 teams take part in each beach volleyball Olympic tournament. Teams qualify on the basis of their performance in FIVB (Fédération Internationale de Volleyball) events over the course of about 18 months before the Olympic Games. There is a limit of two teams per country, and one spot apiece is reserved for the host country and a randomly chosen wild-card country. In the event that any Olympic region is not represented, the highest ranked team from that continent qualifies for the tournament.",164
Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics,Men's beach volleyball,"The men's tournament has had a constant number of teams, with 24 couples in each edition.
In the first tournament, played in the 1996 Olympics, the matches were played at ""Atlanta Beach"" in Jonesboro, Georgia. The winners of the semifinals played for the gold and silver medals. The losers of the semifinal played for third and fourth places. The final was contested between the Americans Karch Kiraly and Kent Steffes versus Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh. Kiraly is so far the only person with Olympic medals in both indoor and beach volleyball since he had won the gold medal indoors in the tournament of 1984 as well as 1988 in Seoul, South Korea.
The beach volleyball tournament of 2000 was played in Bondi Beach, a suburb of Sydney. The winners were again an American team, Blanton/Fonoimoana, defeating Brazilians Zé Marco/Ricardo (the former had competed in Atlanta) in the finals.
In the 2004 Summer Olympics the tournament was held in the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex, in Athens, Greece. The Brazilians Emanuel/Ricardo (the former being a veteran of two Olympics, and the latter a silver medalist in 2000) won the gold medal, defeating Bosma and Herrera of Spain.
The beach volleyball tournament of 2008 was carried out at the Beach Volleyball Ground, located in the Chaoyang Park in Beijing. In an upset, reigning champions Emanuel and Ricardo were defeated by their compatriots Márcio Araújo (who competed in Athens) and Fábio Luiz in the semifinal, having to settle for the bronze (where they beat two Brazilians competing for Georgia). The Brazilian victors were then defeated by Americans Rogers and Dalhausser in the final.
The 2012 tournament was played at the Horse Guards Parade in London. Emanuel Rego, now paired with Alison Cerutti, got his third straight medal, completing the three podium colors, by reaching the finals, where he lost to Germans Brink and Reckermann. Mārtiņš Pļaviņš and Jānis Šmēdiņš from Latvia got the bronze.
After 16 years, the 2016 tournament again was held in an actual beach, Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. Alison Cerutti, now partnered with Bruno Schmidt, returned to the finals, and won the gold beating Daniele Lupo and Paolo Nicolai of Italy in the finals. The Dutch Alexander Brouwer and Robert Meeuwsen completed the podium.
The 2020 Olympics, held in 2021 after a delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, had beach volleyball at Shiokaze Park. Norwegians Anders Mol and Christian Sørum won gold, beating in the final Russians Viacheslav Krasilnikov, who had finished 2016 in fourth place, and Oleg Stoyanovskiy. Brazil missed not only the finals but the podium as a whole for the first time since the inaugural tournament, both pairs eliminated by eventual fourth place team Mārtiņš Pļaviņš and Edgars Točs.",660
Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics,Women's beach volleyball,"In Atlanta, Georgia, in 1996, there were eighteen teams entered, and the championship match was played between two Brazilian teams: Jackie Silva and Sandra Pires versus Mônica Rodrigues and Adriana Samuel. The Australians Natalie Cook and Kerri Pottharst edged out the Americans for the bronze medal.
At the Sydney Olympics of 2000, the number of teams was increased to 24. One of the two Australian teams, Natalie Cook and Kerri Pottharst, won the gold medal over the Brazilians Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede, four years after winning the bronze medal in Atlanta. Another Brazilian team, featuring 1996 champion Sandra Pires and runner-up Adriana Samuel, edged out the Japanese for the bronze medal.
Behar and Bede of Brazil avenged the 2000 defeat by beating Natalie Cook (now partnered with Nicole Sanderson) in the 2004 semifinal to return to the final match, but they were defeated by Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh of the United States. Both May-Treanor and Walsh were veterans of the Sydney Olympics, but Walsh had been part of the American indoor team. Another American team, Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs (the former in her third tournament, having been fourth in Atlanta), defeated the Australian team for the bronze medal.
In 2008 in China, May-Treanor and Walsh (now going by her married name of Walsh Jennings) were victorious again by defeating the Chinese team of Tian Jia and Wang Jie in the finals. Another Chinese team won the bronze medal, edging out Brazil in fourth place, and thus sending the Brazilian women home without a medal for the first time in the tournament history.
In 2012 in England May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings won for the third consecutive Olympiad by defeating the other American team of April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in the championship game. Thus the United States finished with the gold and silver medals, with Brazil winning the bronze medal, edging out China in fourth place.
The 2016 tournament in Brazil had the country return to the beach volleyball final after 12 years, with Ágatha Bednarczuk and Bárbara Seixas winning the semifinal over defending champion Walsh Jennings and London silver medalist April Ross. However, they lost the gold medal to the Germans Laura Ludwig and Kira Walkenhorst, who had also defeated the Brazilians Talita Antunes (4th in 2008) and Larissa França (bronze in 2012) in the semifinals. Talita and Larissa also lost the bronze medal to the United States, making Walsh Jennings the only player to win four beach volleyball Olympic medals. The defeat also broke a streak where every tournament had one country winning medals with both their teams: Brazil in 1996 (gold and silver) and 2000 (silver and bronze), United States in 2004 (gold and bronze) and 2012 (gold and silver), and China in 2008 (silver and bronze). There were also four teams tied for fifth place: Australia, Canada, Russia, and Switzerland, and hence seven countries were represented in the top eight teams.
The 2020 tournament in Japan had April Ross, now partnered with Alix Klineman, winning the gold in her third try, beating in the finals Australians Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar. Joana Heidrich and Anouk Vergé-Dépré of Switzerland, who had played in separate doubles in Rio, got the bronze. Brazil for the first time missed the semifinals, with at most a pair eliminated in the quarterfinals by the Swiss.
While twelve countries won medals in the male tournament, only six have done so with women. The dominating nations are Brazil and the US. Americans have the most gold medals with four. The only countries outside the six medalists (Brazil, USA, Australia, China and Germany) to reach the semifinals were Japan in 2000 and Latvia in 2020.",816
Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics,1996,"A double-elimination tournament was played for both men and women until a total of four teams qualified for the semifinals: the two finalist teams of the winners bracket and the two finalist teams of the elimination bracket. The men's field had 24 teams, and the women's field had 16.
Competitors were selected through a detailed Olympic qualification process which saw the participation of a total of 587 men's and women's athletes from 46 countries. Each country could qualify up to two teams - host country United States had two spots already guaranteed, with the doubles selected through Olympic Beach Trials held in Baltimore, Maryland.",129
Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics,2000,"Following an expansion on the women's tournament, both competitions had 24 teams. The format became single elimination, preceded by a preliminary round to define the round of 16 teams - the twelve winners of the preliminary games automatically qualified, while the twelve defeated teams played two elimination rounds to get the remaining four spots.
The teams qualify by accumulating points in FIVB Olympic Qualification Tournaments, with one of the host nation having a guaranteed berth and another having the possibility of qualifying through the ranking.",101
Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics,2004,"Following a FIVB change of rules in 2001, the scoring was changed from sets of 15 points in a superseded sideout system to sets of 21 points in a rally point system.The format had the 24 competing teams were split equally into six pools of four. The top two teams from each pool and the four best third placed teams progressed through to a single-elimination tournament of sixteen teams.
The qualifying added a continental quota - in the event of an unrepresented continent, the top team from that continent earned a spot.",112
Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics,2008–2020,"The six pools of four format was retained, but the qualifying for third-placed teams was changed. Of the six 3rd place teams, two were directly qualified to the playoffs. Of the four remaining third placed teams, another two teams get to the playoffs through winning a lucky loser (repechage) match.",66
Volleyball at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The volleyball tournaments at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were played between 24 July and 8 August 2021. 24 volleyball teams and 48 beach volleyball teams participated in the tournament. The indoor volleyball competition took place at Ariake Arena in Ariake, and the beach volleyball tournament at Shiokaze Park, in the temporary Shiokaze Park Stadium.
It was originally scheduled to take place in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee announced on 24 March 2020 that the 2020 Summer Olympics would be delayed to 2021.",118
Synchronized swimming,Summary,"Synchronised swimming (in American English, synchronized swimming) or artistic swimming is a sport where swimmers perform a synchronized choreographed routine, accompanied by music. The sport is governed internationally by the Fédération internationale de natation (FINA), known as the International Swimming Federation in english. It is a popular women's sport. 
Synchronised swimming has been part of the Summer Olympics program since 1984 and now features women's duet and team events. But no men can compete in the Olympics. On instruction of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FINA renamed the sport from ""synchronized swimming"" to ""artistic swimming"" in 2017—a decision that has faced controversy.",150
Synchronized swimming,History,"At the turn of the 20th century, synchronised swimming was known as water ballet. The first recorded competition was in 1891 in Berlin, Germany. Many swim clubs were formed around that time, and the sport simultaneously developed in Canada. As well as existing as a sport, it often constituted a popular addition to Music Hall evenings, in the larger variety theatres of London or Glasgow which were equipped with on-stage water tanks for the purpose.
In 1907, Australian Annette Kellermann popularised the sport when she performed in a glass tank as an underwater ballerina (the first water ballet in a glass tank) in the New York Hippodrome.  But, Mathew Woods recorded ladies swimming about to music in a glass tank, in London in 1887. This was in his book Rambles of a Physician. After experimenting with various diving actions and stunts in the water, Katherine Curtis started one of the first water ballet clubs at the University of Chicago, where the team began executing strokes, ""tricks,"" and floating formations. On May 27, 1939, the first U.S. synchronised swimming competition took place at Wright Junior College between Wright and the Chicago Teachers' College.In 1924, the first competition in North America was in Montreal, with Peg Seller as the first champion.
Other important pioneers of the sport are Beulah Gundling, Käthe Jacobi, Marion Kane Elston, Dawn Bean, Billie MacKellar, Teresa Anderson, Gail Johnson, Gail Emery, Charlotte Davis, Mary Derosier, Norma Olsen and Clark Leach. Charlotte Davis coached Tracie Ruiz and Candy Costie, who won the gold medal in duet synchronised swimming at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.
In 1933 and 1934, Katherine Whitney Curtis organised a show, ""The Kay Curtis Modern Mermaids"", for the World Exhibition in Chicago. The announcer, Norman Ross, introduced the sport as ""synchronised swimming"" for the first time.  The term eventually became standardised through the AAU, but Curtis still used the term ""rhythmic swimming"" in her book, Rhythmic Swimming: A Source Book of Synchronised Swimming and Water Pageantry (Minneapolis: Burgess Publishing Co., 1936).
Curtis persuaded the AAU to make synchronised swimming an officially recognised sport in December 1941, but she herself transferred overseas in 1943. She served as the Recreation Director of the Red Cross under Generals Patton and Eisenhower, during which time she produced the first international aquacade in Caserta, Italy. She was the Director of Travel in post-war Europe until 1962. In 1959 the Helms Hall of Fame officially recognised Curtis (along with Annette Kellerman) – ascribing to her the primary development of synchronised swimming.  In 1979 the International Swimming Hall of Fame inducted Curtis with similar accolades.The first Official National Team Championships were held in Chicago at Riis Pool on August 11, 1946. The Town Club 'C' team were the first national champions. The team was composed of:  Polly Wesner, Nancy Hanna, Doris Dieskow, Marion Mittlacher, Shirley Brown, Audrey Huettenrauch, Phyllis Burrell and Priscilla Hirsch.Esther Williams, a national AAU champion swimmer, popularized synchronised swimming during WWII and after, through (often elaborately staged) scenes in Hollywood films such as Bathing Beauty (1944), Million Dollar Mermaid (1952), and Jupiter's Darling (1955). In the 1970s and 1980s, Ft. Lauderdale swimming champion Charkie Phillips revived water ballet on television with The Krofftettes in The Brady Bunch Hour (1976–1977), NBC's The Big Show (1980), and then on screen with Miss Piggy in The Great Muppet Caper (1981).
Margaret Swan Forbes published Coaching Synchronized Swimming Effectively in 1984; it was the first official teaching manual for synchronized swimming.In July 2017, following a request by the IOC, FINA approved changes to its constitution that renamed synchronised swimming to ""artistic swimming"". FINA justified the change by stating that it would help to clarify the nature of the sport (with the new name being similar to artistic gymnastics), and claimed it would help ""enhance its popularity"". The changes received criticism, with swimmers and coaches arguing that they were never consulted, and that the name ""artistic swimming"" diminishes the athleticism of the sport which already had historically faced an ""uphill battle to be taken seriously"". Another objection raised was that rebranding would cost federations and other groups involved in the sport sums of money that neither the IOC nor FINA was willing to compensate. Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko vowed that the country would still refer to the sport as synchronised swimming, stating that ""to keep the name synchronised swimming is our right, and if the Federation itself, the coaches will want it, we will do it"". Since then, most national governing bodies have adopted the new name, some such as the U.S. adopted it after a delay (in 2020), with the CEO of USA Artistic Swimming stating that ""19 of the top 25 countries in the world are either partially or fully using the name artistic swimming"". Competitions where the new name was first used include the 2019 World Aquatics Championships and the 2018 Asian Games. It will also be used at the 2020 Summer Olympics and the 2020 European Aquatics Championships.",1138
Synchronized swimming,Olympic Games,"The first Olympic demonstration was at the 1952 Olympic Games, where the Helsinki officials welcomed Kay Curtis and lit a torch in her honor.  Curtis died in 1980, but synchronised swimming did not become an official Olympic sport until the 1984 Summer Olympic Games.  It was not until 1968 that synchronised swimming became officially recognized by FINA as the fourth water sport next to swimming, platform diving and water polo.
From 1984 through 1992, the Summer Olympic Games featured solo and duet competitions, but they were both dropped in 1996 in favor of team competition. At the 2000 Olympic Games, however, the duet competition was restored and is now featured alongside the team competition.",138
Synchronized swimming,World Aquatics Championships,"Synchronized swimming has been part of the World Aquatics Championships since the beginning. From 1973 through 2001, the World Aquatics Championships featured solo, duet and team competitions. In 2003, a free routine combination, comprising elements of solo, duet and team, was added. In 2005, it was renamed free combination. In 2007, solo, duet and team events were split between technical and free routines. Since 2007, seven World championship titles are at stake. In 2015, the mixed duet (technical and free) were added to the competition program.",120
Synchronized swimming,Sculls,"Sculls (hand movements used to propel the body) are some of the most essential part to synchronised swimming. Commonly used sculls include support scull, stationary scull, propeller scull, alligator scull, torpedo scull, split scull, barrel scull, spinning scull and paddle scull. The support scull is used most often to support the body while a swimmer is performing upside down.
The support scull or ""American Scull"" was invented by Marion Kane Elston and propelled the sport to new heights. The sport was transformed from water ballet to the athleticism of modern-day synchronized swimming. See the International Swimming Hall of Fame as a reference.
Support scull is performed by holding the upper arms against the sides of the body and the fore arms at 90-degree angles to the body, with hands facing the bottom of the pool. The fore arms are then moved back and forth while maintaining the right angle. The resulting pressure against the hands allows the swimmer to hold their legs above water while upside down.",222
Synchronized swimming,Eggbeater,"The ""eggbeater kick"" is another important skill of synchronised swimming. It is a form of treading water that allows for stability and height above the water while leaving the hands free to perform arm motions. An average eggbeater height is usually around collarbone level. Eggbeater is used in all ""arm"" sections, a piece of choreography in which the swimmer is upright, often with one or both arms in the air. Another variation is a body boost, which is executed through an eggbeater buildup and a strong whip kick, propelling the swimmer out of the water vertically. A body boost can raise a swimmer out of the water to hip level.",143
Synchronized swimming,Lifts and highlights,"A lift or highlight is when members of the team propel another teammate relatively high out of the water. They are quite common in routines of older age groups and higher skill levels.
There are many variations on lifts and these can include partner lifts, float patterns or other areas of unique, artistic choreography intended to exceptionally impress the judges and audience.",73
Synchronized swimming,Parts,"There are three parts to every lift in synchronised swimming: The top (or ""flyer""), the base, and the pushers. Sometimes there is no base and the pushers push the flyer directly.

The Flyer is usually the smallest member of the team. Flyers must be agile and flexible, with a preferable gymnastics background if they are jumping off the lift.
The Base tends to be of average size. Intense leg strength and a solid core is mandatory as well as the ability to hold a squat position.
The Feet/Lifters/Pushers are the team members that provide the force for the base to explosively stand up, and the flyer to gain height out of the water.",150
Synchronized swimming,Common types,"The platform lift is the oldest form of highlight. In a platform, the base lays out in a back layout position underwater. The top sets in a squatting position on her torso and stands once the lift reaches the surface. The remaining teammates use eggbeater to hold the platform and the top out of the water.
The stack lift is the most common form of lifts in synchro. The base sets up in a squatting position a few feet underwater, with the lifters holding her feet and/or legs. The top then squats on the shoulders of the base. As the lift rises, lifters extend their arms while the base and top extend their legs to achieve maximum height. A common addition to a stack lift is a rotation while it ascends or descends.
A toss or throw is set up exactly like a stack lift. However, when the lift reaches its full height, the ""flyer"" on top of the lift will jump off of their teammate's shoulders, usually performing some sort of acrobatic movement or position. This is a very difficult lift and should only be attempted by experienced swimmers.
A basket or bunken toss is a newer form of highlight that utilizes a small platform created by the interlocking hands of two lifters persons, with the flyer standing on their hands, and the base inverted standing on the underside of their hands. There will be one person lifting each of the lifters’ waists, and another person deep under the basket assisting the base in remaining vertical. These highlights are often used by national teams to achieve exceptional height out of the water for the flyer.",332
Synchronized swimming,Positions,"There are hundreds of different regular positions that can be used to create seemingly infinite combinations. These are a few basic and commonly used ones:

Back Layout: The most basic position. The body floats, completely straight and rigid, face-up on the surface while sculling under the hips.
 Back Tuck Somersault:  Start in a back layout position. Bring your legs into your chest and pivot yourself backwards doing a full rotation or 360. From the tuck position, extend your legs and finish in a back layout position.
Ballet Leg: Beginning in a back layout, one leg is extended and held perpendicular to the body, while the other is held parallel to the surface of the water.
Bent Knee (or Heron): While holding a vertical body position, one leg remains vertical while the other leg bends so that its toe is touching the knee of the vertical leg.
Crane (or Fishtail): While holding a vertical body position, one leg remains vertical while the other is dropped parallel to the surface, making a 90-degree angle or ""L"" shape. More specifically, a crane position requires the 90-degree angle in the legs (even if the bottom leg is submerged), while a fishtail requires the bottom foot to be at the surface which may or may not create a 90-degree angle in the legs depending on height.
Double Ballet Leg: Similar to ballet leg position where both legs are extended and held perpendicular to the body.
Flamingo: Similar to ballet leg position where bottom leg is pulled into the chest so that the shin of the bottom leg is touching the knee of the vertical leg, while remaining parallel to the surface of the water.
Front Layout: Much like a Back Layout, the only difference is that the swimmer is on his/her stomach, sculling by his/her chest, and not breathing.
 Front Walkover:  Begin in a front layout position. Scull downwards into a pike position. Lift one leg vertically into a crane position. Lower that same leg into a split position. Lift the remaining leg vertically into a knight position. Lower the remaining leg and scull above your head into a back layout position.
Knight: The body is in a surface arch position, where the legs are flat on the surface, and the body is arched so that the head is vertically in line with the hips. One leg is lifted, creating a vertical line perpendicular to the surface.
Side Fishtail: Side fishtail is a position which one leg remains vertical, while the other is extended out to the side parallel to the water, creating a side ""Y"" position.
Split Position: With the body vertical, one leg is stretched forward along the surface and the other extended back along the surface, in an upside down split position.
Tower:  Start in a front layout position. Scull downwards into a pike position. Lift one leg vertically into a crane position. Lift the other leg into a vertical position and descend into the water.
Tub: Both legs are pulled up to the chest with the shins and tops of the feet dry and parallel on the surface of the water.
Vertical:   Achieved by holding the body completely straight upside down and perpendicular to the surface usually with both legs entirely out of water.The International Olympic Committee has further described the technical positions.",696
Synchronized swimming,Routine,"Routines are composed of ""figures"" (leg movements), arm sections and highlights. Swimmers are synchronised both to each other and to the music.  During a routine swimmers can never use the bottom of the pool for support, but rather depend on sculling motions with the arms, and eggbeater kick to keep afloat. After the performance, the swimmers are judged and scored on their performance based on execution, artistic impression, and difficulty. Execution of technical skill, difficulty, patterns, choreography, and synchronization are all critical to achieving a high score.",121
Synchronized swimming,Technical vs. free routines,"Depending on the competition level, swimmers will perform a ""technical"" routine with predetermined elements that must be performed in a specific order. The technical routine acts as a replacement for the figure event. In addition to the technical routine, the swimmers will perform a longer ""free"" routine, which has no requirements and is a chance for the swimmers to get creative and innovative with their choreography.",86
Synchronized swimming,Length,"The type of routine and competition level determines the length of routines. Routines typically last two to four minutes, the shortest being the technical solo, with length added as the number of swimmers is increased (duets, teams, combos and highlight). Age and skill level are other important factors in determining the required routine length.",68
Synchronized swimming,Scoring,"Routines are scored on a scale of 100, with points for execution, artistic impression, and difficulty.
In group routines a group consists of 8 competitors for World Championships and FINA events, each missing participant brings penalty points to the team. A group can consist of a minimum of 4 competitors and a maximum of 10 (for Free Combination and Highlight). If a swimmer uses the bottom, they will be disqualified.",90
Synchronized swimming,Preparation,"When performing routines in competition and practice, competitors wear a rubber noseclip to keep water from entering their nose when submerged. Some swimmers wear earplugs to keep the water out of their ears. Hair is worn in a bun and flavorless gelatin, Knox, is applied to keep hair in place; a decorative headpiece is bobby-pinned to the bun. Occasionally, swimmers wear custom-made swimming caps in place of their hair in buns.
Competitors wear custom swimsuits, usually elaborately decorated with bright fabric and sequins to reflect the music to which they are swimming. The costume and music are not judged but create an aesthetic appeal to the audience.
Makeup is also worn in this sport, but FINA has required a more natural look. No ""theatrical make-up"" is allowed, only makeup that provides a natural, clean and healthy glow is acceptable. In Canada, eye makeup must be smaller than a circle made by the swimmer's thumb and forefinger, and be used solely for ""natural enhancement"".
Underwater speakers ensure that swimmers can hear the music and aid their ability to synchronize with each other. Routines are prepared and set to counts in the music to further ensure synchronization. Coaches use underwater speakers to communicate with the swimmers during practice. Goggles, though worn during practice, are not permitted during routine competition.",287
Synchronized swimming,Figures,"A standard meet begins with the swimmers doing ""figures"", which are progressions between positions performed individually without music. All swimmers must compete wearing the standard black swimsuit and white swim cap, as well as goggles and a noseclip. Figures are performed in front of a panel of 5 judges who score individual swimmers from 1 to 10 (10 being the best). The figure competition prefaces the routine events. However, figures are only performed when a swimmer is under the age of 15/16 and has not reached the junior age group.",114
Synchronized swimming,United States,"In the United States, competitors are divided into groups by age. The eight age groups are: 12 and under, 13–15, 16–17, 18–19, Junior (elite 15–18), Senior (elite 15+), Collegiate, and Master.  In addition to these groups, younger swimmers may be divided by ability into 3 levels: Novice, Intermediate, and age group. Certain competitions require the athlete(s) to pass a certain Grade Level. Grades as of now range from Level one to Level six, and will soon go to Level ten. Seasons range in length, and some swimmers participate year-round in competitions. There are many levels of competition, including but not limited to: State, Regional, Zone, National, Junior Olympic, and US Junior and Senior Opens. Each swimmer may compete in the following routine events: solo, duet, combo (consisting of ten swimmers), and team (consisting of eight swimmers). In the 12 & under and 13-15 age groups, figure scores are combined with routines to determine the final rankings. The 16-17 and 18-19 age groups combine the scores of the technical and free routines to determine the final rankings. USA Synchro's annual intercollegiate championships have been dominated by The Ohio State University, Stanford University, Lindenwood University (which no longer has a collegiate program), and The University of the Incarnate Word.",300
Synchronized swimming,Canada,"In Canada, as of 2010, synchronized swimming has an age-based structure system with age groups 10 & under, 12 & under, and 13–15 for the provincial levels.  There is also a skill level which is 13–15 and juniors (16–18) known as national stream, as well as competition at the Masters and University levels. The 13–15 age group and 16–18 age group are national stream athletes that align with international age groups – 15 and Under and Junior (16–18) and Senior (18+) level athletes. Wildrose age group is for competitors before they reach 13–15 national stream. Wildrose ranges from Tier 8 and under 16 and over provincial/wildrose. These are also competitive levels. Recreational levels, called ""stars"", also exist. Synchro Canada requires that a competitor must pass Star 3 before entering Tier 1. To get into a Tier a swimmer must take a test for that Tier. In these tests, the swimmer must be able to perform the required movements for the level. (Canada no longer uses Tiers as a form of level placement). The Canadian University synchronised swimming League (CUASL) is intended for Canadian Swimmers who wish to continue their participation in the sport during their university studies, as well as offering a ""Novice"" category for those new to the sport. Traditionally, the top teams hail from McGill University, Queens University and the University of Ottawa.",299
Synchronized swimming,Men's and mixed competition,"Some international, national and regional competitions allow men to compete, and the Fédération internationale de natation (FINA) introduced a new mixed duet competition at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships.
In the late 19th century, synchronised swimming was a male-only event. However, in the 20th century it became a women's sport, with men banned from many competitions. In the U.S., men were allowed to participate with women until 1941, when synchronised swimming became part of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). The AAU required men and women to compete separately, which resulted in a decline of male participants. In the 1940s and 1950s, Bert Hubbard and Donn Squire were among the top US male competitors.In 1978, the U.S. changed their rules to allow men to once again compete with women. Rules in other countries varied; in the UK, men were prohibited from competing until 2014, while in France, Benoît Beaufils was allowed to competed at national events in the 1990s. American Bill May was a top competitor in the late-1990s and early-2000s. He medalled in several international events, including the 1998 Goodwill Games. However, male competitors were barred from top competitions, including the World Aquatics Championships and the Olympics. However, at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships, FINA introduced a new mixed duet discipline. Both May and Beaufils returned from decade-long retirements to represent their countries. Among their competitors were Russian Aleksandr Maltsev and Italian Giorgio Minisini, both over 15 years younger than May and Beaufils. Pairs from ten countries competed in the inaugural events. The 2016 European Aquatics Championships was the first time men were allowed to compete at the European Championships. While men are allowed in more events, they were still barred from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics. FINA did propose adding the mixed duet competition to the 2020 Summer Olympics.",413
Synchronized swimming,Injuries,"Common injuries that may occur in synchronized swimming are tendon injuries, as the sport tends to cause muscle imbalances. Common joint injuries include the rotator cuff and the knees.
In their 2012 book Concussions and Our Kids, Dr. Robert Cantu and Mark Hyman quoted Dr. Bill Moreau, the medical director for the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC), as saying, ""These women are superior athletes. They're in the pool eight hours a day. Literally, they're within inches of one another, sculling and paddling. As they go through their various routines, they're literally kicking each other in the head."" Dr. Moreau said that during a two-week training session in Colorado Springs, the female athletes suffered a 50% concussion rate. As a result, the USOC began reassessing concussion awareness and prevention for all sports.Others believe the incidence of concussions among synchronized swimmers is much higher, especially among the sport's elite athletes. ""I would say 100 percent of my athletes will get a concussion at some point,"" said Myriam Glez, a former French synchronized swimmer and coach. ""It might be minor, might be more serious, but at some point or another, they will get hit.""",259

List of cyclists at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"This is a list of cyclists who competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. The cyclists competed in 22 cycling events in the disciplines: BMX, mountain biking, road cycling, and track cycling.",46
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The cycling competitions of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo featured 22 events in five disciplines. The 2020 Olympics were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Cycling competitions had been contested in every Summer Olympics programme since the first modern Olympiad in 1896 alongside athletics, artistic gymnastics, fencing and swimming.
Since the 1896 contests which featured five track events and an 87 km road race from Athens to Marathon and back, Olympic cycling had gradually evolved to include women's competitions, mountain bike and BMX to arrive at the current 22 events.
The cycling program for this edition was expanded with 4 more events than those held in 2016. BMX freestyle was added in the program for the first time and there will also be a return of Madison events on the track that had been removed from the Olympic program in 2008. The award of the extra events was widely seen as a reward for the agreement of the UCI that the track cycling and mountain bike events be taken out of Tokyo and held in Izu, Shizuoka, allowing for significant costs savings to the organising committee. As Izu was not covered by the state of emergency imposed by the Japanese government, cycling was one of the very few sports at these games that allowed a limited number of local spectators to attend.
Great Britain's stranglehold on the velodrome events slackened for the first time since 2008, with their three golds matched by the Netherlands and six other golds shared among six nations. They also failed to win a road medal for the first time since 2004. Nevertheless with three golds, three silvers and a bronze inside the velodrome, and a hugely successful mountain bike and BMX campaign outside it (three golds, a silver and a bronze from the six events) for the fourth Olympics in a row, Great Britain topped the medal table in cycling with twelve medals, six gold, closely followed by the Netherlands with twelve medals but five golds. Between them the two top nations won half of all the 22 gold medals on offer in cycling; no other nation won more than one, and aside from 12 medals won by each of the 'Big 2', only the Swiss managed more than three medals in total, thanks to their dominance of the mountain bike podium (winning 4 medals from 6).
During the Games, Jason Kenny and Laura Kenny respectively took the records for the most sucessful male and female Olympic cyclists in history, Jason with a seventh gold in men's kierin, and Laura with a fifth in women's madison. They also became their nation's most successful male and female Olympians in history.",535
Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Venues,"Track cycling was planned for a temporary venue in Ariake. To save $100 million in construction costs, it was announced after months of negotiations that the venue for track cycling would be the existing velodrome in Izu.The International Cycling Union (UCI) resisted moving track cycling 120 km outside Tokyo to Izu. The UCI feared it would detract from the Olympic experience for both athletes and fans. Eventually the UCI agreed to change. The Japanese Cycling Federation and local authorities committed to establishing at Izu a multi-sport cycling center, to create local cycling programs, and to develop the cycling sport.For road cycling the start and finish were originally planned at the Imperial Palace Garden. Later it was announced that the finishes would be at the Fuji International Speedway with the starts of the road races at the Musashinonomori Park.",173

The men's road race was 234 kilometres long with a total elevation of 4865 m. The women's race was 137 km long with a total elevation of 2692 metres.The first part of the men's and women's races is identical. The course first passes through the mostly flat outskirts of Tokyo's metropolitan area. After 80 km there is a long climb on Doushi Road with a total elevation of 1000 m. After reaching Lake Yamanakako in Yamanashi and crossing the Kagosaka Pass there is a fast 15 km descent. From here the courses are different for men and women.
After the descent, the men's race heads towards the lower slopes of Mount Fuji, Japan's highest mountain, with a 14.3 km long climb with a 6.0% average incline. The riders then head to the Fuji Speedway section, where they  cross the finish line twice before entering the last part of the race, which includes the Mikuni Pass peak at about 30 km to go. This climb is 6.8 km at a height of 1159 metres with an average incline of 10.2% including sections reaching 20%. After the climb, the race returns to Lake Yamanakako and the Kagosaka Pass before finishing on the Fuji Speedway circuit.
The women's race does not include the two tough climbs at Mount Fuji and Mikuni Pass. Instead, the race remains on the Fuji Speedway circuit, where the women ride 1.5 laps before the final crossing of the finish line.",362

Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Qualification,Qualifying criteria,"The main qualifying criterion will be players' positions on the ATP and WTA ranking lists published on 14 June 2021 (after 2021 French Open). The players entering were formally submitted by the International Tennis Federation. The ATP and WTA rankings were based on performances from the previous 52 weeks, and there were several tournaments in the two-month period between the time of the rankings being frozen for entry and the beginning of the tennis events at the Olympics. Players had to be part of a nominated team for three Billie Jean King Cup (women) or Davis Cup (men) events between the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. This requirement was reduced to two Fed/Davis Cup events during the Olympic cycle from 2016 to 2020 if their nation competed at the Zone Group round robin level for three of the four years or if the player had represented their nation at least twenty times. All players were required to have been part of a nominated team for a Fed/Davis Cup event in 2019 or 2020, and to have had a good standing with their National Olympic Committee.Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter 6 male and 6 female athletes, with a maximum of 4 entries in the individual events, and 2 pairs in the doubles events. A total of 172 athletes will qualify to compete.
For the singles competitions, the top 56 players in the world rankings on a later date to be announced of the WTA and ATP tours are qualified for the Olympics. However, entry has been limited to four players from a country.  This means that players who are ranked in the top 56 but represent the NOCs with four higher-ranked players already participating do not qualify, allowing players who are ranked outside of the top 56 but from countries with fewer than four players already qualified to compete. A player could only participate if they been part of a final nominated team to represent their country in Davis Cup or Billie Jean King Cup (formerly known as Fed Cup) ties on three occasions during the olympic cycle, with one of the years featuring a nomination being either 2019 or 2020–21. The required nominations was reduced to two if the player represented a nation spending at least three of the four seasons in the Olympic cycle on the zonal level of the relevant Cup or had been nominated for at least 20 ties during their career. Six of the remaining eight slots will be allocated by continent: two in the 2019 Pan American Games, one in the 2018 Asian Games, one in the 2019 African Games, and one each for Europe and Oceania for the highest-ranked athlete from an NOC with no other qualifiers. The final two spots are reserved, one for the host nation and one for a previous Olympic gold medalist or Grand Slam champion who didn't secure a direct entry.In the men's and women's doubles competitions, 32 teams qualify. Up to 10 places are reserved for players in the top 10 of the doubles ranking, who could select any player from their NOC ranked in the top 300. Slots were then allocated to teams with the best combined ranking until 24 teams had been qualified. If the quota of 86 players in the relevant gender had not yet been met, additional places continued to be allotted via combined ranking. Once the quota was met, remaining teams with both players qualified in the singles were selected based on their best combined ranking. If this resulted in fewer than 32 teams, additional places were assigned to teams with one player qualified in singles, followed by remaining teams without any singles-qualified players if necessary. One team per gender was reserved for the host nation.No quota spots are available for mixed doubles; instead, all teams have to consist of players already on site having qualified in the singles or doubles. Fifteen teams, based on combined ranking, and the host nation qualified.",761

Modern pentathlon at the Summer Olympics,Development as an Olympic sport,"Modern pentathlon was created by the founder of the modern Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, and was first contested in 1912. Coubertin was inspired by the pentathlon event in Ancient Olympic Games, which was modeled after the skills of the ideal soldier at the time. Modern pentathlon was also influenced by the tradition of civilian and military multi-sport events in Sweden at the beginning of the 20th century. It combined events that were considered to be of upper-class origin like épée fencing, pistol shooting and riding with more popular ones like running and swimming.The five events making up modern pentathlon are (as of 2021):

épée fencing
200 metre freestyle swimming
show jumping with an unfamiliar horse
3 km cross country running
pistol shooting (as laser pistol shooting in an combined event with running)After more than half a century of relative stability, modern pentathlon has been the subject of numerous changes since the 1980s with its place on the Olympic programme in question several times.Beginning at the 1996 Summer Olympics, the five components were held on a single day instead of five. The same year, the Men's team competition was dropped from the Olympics. The women's event was first introduced at the 2000 Summer Olympics. 
Since the 2008 Summer Olympics, the air-pistol shooting is held during the 3 km run. Since the 2012 Summer Olympics, shooting is done using a laser gun, and running and shooting was combined as one event.Modern pentathlon was still criticized as outdated and lacking popularity in the 2010s. The Associated Press reported in 2013 that the International Olympic Committee was considering dropping it from the Olympics. In response to the criticism, the sport's governing body, the UIPM, made changes to the sport, including by having all five contests held in a single stadium. It was planned for the 2016 Summer Olympics but held for the first time at the 2020 Summer Olympics.The events of modern pentathlon at the Olympic Games were as follows:",414
Modern pentathlon at the Summer Olympics,Horse Riding,"The horse riding event in modern pentathlon has been debated - for different reasons - since the invention of the sport. Coubertin and the organisers of the 1912 Summer Olympics had different views on the availability of horses: Coubertin wanted randomly assigned horses provided by the hosts while the Swedish committee preferred that the competitors bring their own horses.For the 1988 Summer Olympics cross-country riding was changed to show jumping.
In November 2021, UIPM announced that show jumping would not be a part of the Olympic modern pentathlon starting from the 2028 Summer Olympics, which was connected to an incident in the 2020 Games where German women's coach Kim Raisner had punched pentathlete Annika Schleu's horse. In response, 650 pentathletes put their names on a letter criticizing the lack of collaboration with them and asking for UIPM executives to resign, with UIPM stating it will discuss the matter with them.",190

Fencing at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's épée,Qualification,"A National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 3 qualified fencers in the women's épée. Nations were limited to three fencers each from 1996 to 2004. However, the 2008 Games introduced a rotation of women's team fencing events with one weapon left off each Games; the individual event without a corresponding team event had the number of fencers per nation reduced to two. Women's épée was the first event this applied to, so each nation could enter a maximum of two fencers in the event in 2008. The 2020 Games eliminated this rotation and all weapons had team events.There are 34 dedicated quota spots for women's épée. The first 24 spots go to the 3 members of each of the 8 qualified teams in the team épée event (China, Poland, ROC, South Korea, Hong Kong, United States, Italy, and Estonia). Next, 6 more fencers are selected from the world rankings based on continents: 2 from Europe, 1 from the Americas, 2 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa.

Each nation can earn only one spot through rankings or events.Additionally, there are 8 host/invitational spots that can be spread throughout the various fencing events. Japan qualified one fencer through normal qualification, but used no host quota places in women's épée.

Fencing at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's épée,Competition format,"The 1996 tournament had vastly simplified the competition format for individual fencing competitions into a single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match.

At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer is the winner; a tie results in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period is further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scores a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner wins the bout. Standard épée rules regarding target area, striking, and priority are used.",153

The 2020 Olympics were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) is permitted to enter a maximum of six competitors, three per gender. NOCs that qualify teams for a particular gender are able to send a three-member team to the team event and also have each member compete in the individual event. There are 12 team spots for each gender, thus qualifying 36 individuals through team qualification. All other NOCs may earn a maximum of one quota place per gender for the individual events.Six places are reserved for Japan as the host nation, and a further four will be decided by the Tripartite Commission. The remaining 118 places are then allocated through a qualification process, in which archers earn quota places for their respective NOCs, though not necessarily for themselves.There is no qualification process prior to the 2020 Games for the mixed team event. Instead, qualification for that event is done through the ranking rounds at the beginning of the Games. Each NOC that has qualified at least one man and one woman will have the scores of that NOC's top-scoring man and top-scoring woman in the ranking round summed; the top 16 NOCs will qualify for mixed team competition.To be eligible to participate in the Olympic Games after the NOC has obtained a quota place, all archers must have achieved the following minimum qualification score (MQS):

Men: 70m round of 640

Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Qualification,Qualifying standards,"Qualification occurs through a hierarchy of events rather than based on dates, so an NOC that earns qualification through an earlier low-priority event might vacate that quota spot if it later earns qualification in a higher-priority event (this particularly affects the Asian Games, held before the World Championships). The priority is (1) World Championships, (2) continental games, (3) continental championships, (4) final qualification tournaments.The top eight teams in the team event at the World Championships will each qualify a team for the Olympics. If the host, Japan, is one of the top eight, an additional team qualification quota place will be awarded at the Final Team Qualification Tournament. The Final Team Qualification Tournament will fill out the rest of the 12 team quota places, with either three or four teams qualifying depending on whether Japan uses its guaranteed host place or qualifies through competition (including through the Final Team Qualification Tournament itself).For the mixed team events at continental games, the winning team earns one Olympic quota place per gender.The top four finishers in the individual event at the World Championships who are not part of one of the eight best teams will qualify. The World Championships will hold ranking brackets as necessary to determine the placing. For Europe, Asia, and the Americas, one quota place each is available through the continental games. All five continents will hold continental qualification tournaments, with specified numbers of quota places available per continent. A Final Individual Qualification Tournament will be held at the end of the qualification period; initially, one quota place is available through that tournament but more may be available if places from other events are not used.",331

Relay qualification is achieved by a top eight finish at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in a relay event, or a top eight ranking in that event not including previously qualified nations. The first confirmed place was therefore assured when Great Britain finished fourth in the mixed 4 × 400 metres relay event at the Worlds in Doha.

Russian Olympic Committee athletes at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"Prior to the 2019 decision by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Russia was expected to compete at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which took place from 23 July to 8 August 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It would have been the country's seventh consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics as an independent nation, but their athletes were entered by and representing the ""Russian Olympic Committee"", using the acronym ""ROC"" for a country name.
This was the outcome of a decision by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on 9 December 2019 banning Russia from all international sport for four years, after it was found that data provided by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency had been manipulated by Russian authorities with a goal of protecting athletes involved in its state-sponsored doping scheme. As at the 2018 Winter Olympics, WADA would allow individual cleared Russian athletes to compete neutrally under a title to be determined (which may not include the name ""Russia"", unlike the use of ""Olympic Athletes from Russia"" in 2018).Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, on review of Russia's appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as ""Neutral Athlete"" or ""Neutral Team"". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display ""Russia"" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the ""Neutral Athlete/Team"" designation. Russia can appeal the decision.On 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym ""ROC"", after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee. On aftermatch, the IOC announced that the Russian national flag would be substituted by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. It would also not be allowed to use team uniforms bearing the words ""Russian Olympic Committee"", instead the acronym ""ROC"" would be added.On 15 April 2021, the uniforms for the Russian Olympic Committee athletes were unveiled, featuring the colours of the Russian flag. On 22 April 2021, the replacement for Russia's anthem was approved by the IOC, after an earlier choice of the patriotic Russian war song ""Katyusha"" was rejected.  A fragment of Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 is used.On 23 July 2021, the Russian Olympic Committee athletes appeared at the opening ceremony of the 2020 Summer Olympics. With the usage of traditional Japanese characters order, named Gojūon, ROC is not translated into Japanese script and was pronounced āru ō shī, so it placed 77th in the parade, and not as scheduled just after the Refugee Olympic Team (ai ō shī) as had been announced. Representatives of the Russian Olympic Committee did not have Japanese transcription on the back of their nametag, which was carried in front. Channel 1, which was broadcasting the ceremonies, attributed this to the inability to display the name ""ROC"" in Japanese characters.The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the ROC are fencer Sofya Velikaya and volleyball player Maksim Mikhaylov. Wrestler Abdulrashid Sadulaev is the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony.",748

Equestrian at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Dressage,"Teams are made of three athletes, all of whom are also competing for individual medals. Nations without a team can be represented by a single individual athlete.
Dressage competition starts with the Grand Prix, which serves as a qualifier for both team and individual competitions. Athletes are drawn into six heats of ten athletes each, with the opening three heats being scheduled for the first day, and the remaining three heats for the second day. Heats are drawn in such a way that no more than one athlete per NOC can be assigned to the same heat. Once the Grand Prix heats are concluded, team scores are decided by adding up individual scores of the respective team members. The top eight ranked teams qualify for the team final (Grand Prix Special), while the top two individual athletes from each heat, plus the next best six ranked athletes, qualify for the individual final (Grand Prix Freestyle).
Grand Prix Special, which is used to decide team medals, is a slightly more rigorous dressage test with emphasis on difficult transitions (such as collected walk - piaffe). Special is performed to music of athletes' choice, which, however, is not judged. As the slate is wiped clean after the Grand Prix, team medals are determined solely based on scores achieved in the Special. Nations taking part in the team final are allowed to enter a substitute athlete between the Grand Prix and up to two hours before the Special.
Grand Prix Freestyle is open for 18 athletes and is used to decide individual medals. Each athlete designs their own test for the Freestyle, which must be set to music and must contain 16 compulsory movements. Riders can tailor a test to their horses' strengths, as well as incorporate movements that are more difficult than those required in the Grand Prix or the Special (such as a pirouette in piaffe or flying changes on a curving line) in order to increase their scores. Individual medals are assigned based on scores in the Freestyle.",399
Equestrian at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Eventing,"Competitions for team and individual medals run concurrently. Each athlete, riding the same horse, performs a dressage test, a cross-country round, and a jumping round. Team medals are then awarded by adding together the scores of team members, from all three phases. The team with the lowest number of penalty points wins the gold. The top 25 individual athletes after the first jumping round perform a second, final, jumping round to determine individual medals. Therefore, those competing for individual glory complete one dressage test and cross-country round, and two jumping rounds.
Athletes who for various reasons fail to start or finish any of the phases are eliminated from the individual competition. Teams with eliminated athletes receive penalty points: 100 penalty points for each eliminated athlete during dressage and jumping phases, and 200 penalty points for each eliminated athlete during cross-country phase. While they are excluded from the individual event, eliminated athletes may continue to compete in the following phases for their teams, unless they were eliminated for lameness, fall of horse, abuse of horse or otherwise disqualified. Teams can additionally bring forward a reserve athlete at any point of the competition. In such case, the respective team is awarded 20 additional penalty points.",248
Equestrian at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Jumping,"Individual and team competitions are run separately.
Individual competition is up first and it takes two competition days. First competition day serves as a qualifier, where a total of 75 athletes may start. Each athlete tackles the same course, which includes 12 to 14 numbered obstacles. Athletes are ranked based on accumulated number of penalty points, and top 30 advance to individual final. In case of a tie for the last qualification place, athletes are separated by the time of their round. Individual final is held on a different course that includes 12 to 15 numbered obstacles. Athletes are once again ranked based on accumulated number of penalty points. If two or more athletes are tied for a medal position, the tie is resolved in a jump-off.
First day of team competition serves as a qualifier, and is opened to a total of 20 teams. At the end of the qualifier, teams receive their placing by adding up the penalties incurred by the three team members. Athletes who withdraw or are eliminated or who retire from the competition will not be given a score. Teams with one athlete who has withdrawn, retired or been eliminated from the team qualifier will  be placed according to the combined penalties incurred by the two athletes who completed the competition. Teams in which all three athletes completed the competition without being eliminated or retiring shall be placed before teams with only two athletes who completed the competition without being eliminated or retiring. Teams with two athletes who have withdrawn and/or retired and/or been eliminated from the competition will be eliminated. The top 10 teams based on the qualifier results advance to team final. In case of a tie for the last qualification place, teams are separated by the combined time of their three team members. Team final is held on a different course. Teams are once again ranked based on accumulated number of penalty points of their team members. If two or more teams are tied for a medal position, the tie is resolved in a jump-off.",390

Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, it was postponed in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was held largely behind closed doors with no spectators permitted under the state of emergency.

Venues of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics,Venues and infrastructure,"In February 2012, it was announced that former Tokyo's National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics. In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and ""optimize"" the design.In June 2015, the government announced it was planning to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure. The original plans to build a retractable roof were also scrapped. As a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the stadium, which reached ¥252 billion, the government ultimately chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design had a budget of ¥149 billion. Changes in plans prevented the new stadium from being completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended. National Stadium was inaugurated on 21 December 2019 and is named Olympic Stadium during 2020 Olympic Games.Of the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 are within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues which were constructed.

Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"A number of concerns and controversies arose leading up to the 2020 Summer Olympics, which took place in  Tokyo, Japan. The games were postponed until July 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The IOC stated that their Japanese partners and the former prime minister Shinzo Abe ""made it very clear"" in 2020, ""that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest"". Just weeks before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, honorary patron Emperor Naruhito was said to be ""extremely worried about the current status of coronavirus infections"", and was ""concerned that while there [were] voices of anxiety among the public, the holding (of the events) may lead to the expansion of infections"".There were allegations of bribery in the Japanese Olympic Committee's (JOC) bid for the games, of plagiarism in the initial design for the games' logo, and of illegal overwork of laborers on the part of dozens of companies involved in construction for the games. Notable safety concerns for athletes included radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, water quality, and record heat levels. Political controversies included the use of maps showing disputed territories as part of Japan, and a refusal to ban the Rising Sun Flag at Olympic venues.",262
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Bribery and corruption,"In January 2016, the second part of a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commission report into corruption included a footnote detailing a conversation between Khalil Diack, son of former International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) President Lamine Diack, and Turkish officials from the Istanbul bid team. A transcript of the conversation cited in the report suggested that a ""sponsorship"" payment of between US$4 and 5 million had been made by the Japanese bid team ""either to the Diamond League or IAAF"". The footnote claimed that because Istanbul did not make such a payment, the bid lost the support of Lamine Diack. The WADA declined to investigate the claim because it was, according to its independent commission, outside the agency's remit.In July and October 2013 (prior to, and after, being awarded the Games), Tokyo made two bank payments totaling 2.8 million Singapore dollars to a Singapore-based company known as Black Tidings. The company is tied to Papa Massata Diack, a son of Lamine Diack, who worked as a marketing consultant for the IAAF, and is being pursued by French authorities under allegations of bribery, corruption, and money laundering. Black Tidings is held by Ian Tan Tong Han, a consultant to Athletics Management and Services—which manages the IAAF's commercial rights and has business relationships with Japanese firm Dentsu. Black Tidings has also been connected to a doping scandal involving the Russian athletics team.Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) and Tokyo 2020 board member Tsunekazu Takeda stated that the payments were for consulting services, but refused to discuss the matter further because it was confidential. Toshiaki Endo called on Takeda to publicly discuss the matter. Massata Diack denied that he had received any money from Tokyo's organising committee. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) named a team to investigate these matters, and will closely follow the French investigation.In January 2019, a source revealed that Takeda was being formally investigated over alleged corruption. On 19 March 2019, Takeda resigned from the JOC.In November 2019, it was reported that the Tokyo Olympic bid committee's accounting documents, detailing over 900 million yen (≈ 8 million US$) spent on overseas consultancy firms for Tokyo's 2020 Olympics hosting bid, were missing.In September 2020, the FinCEN Files revealed how payments had been made to the son of an influential IOC member in relation to winning the bid for the Olympic Games.On 7 June 2021, Moriya Yasushi, the accounting manager of JOC, committed suicide. There was no suicide note and the motive for his suicide is unknown.",549
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Logo plagiarism,"The initial designs for the official emblems of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 24 July 2015. The logo resembled a stylised ""T"": a red circle in the top-right corner representing a beating heart, the flag of Japan, and ""an inclusive world in which everyone accepts each other""; and a dark grey column in the centre representing diversity. The Paralympic emblem inverted the light and dark columns of the pattern to resemble an equal sign.Shortly after the unveiling, Belgian graphics designer Olivier Debie accused the organising committee of plagiarising a logo he had designed for the Théâtre de Liège, which, aside from the circle, consisted of nearly identical shapes. Tokyo's organising committee denied that the emblem design was plagiarised, arguing that the design had gone through ""long, extensive and international"" intellectual property examinations before it was cleared for use. Debie filed a lawsuit against the IOC to prevent use of the infringing logo.The Tokyo emblem's designer, Kenjirō Sano, defended the design, stating that he had never seen the Liège logo, while the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) released an early sketch of the design that emphasised a stylised ""T"" and did not resemble the Liège logo. Moreover, Sano was found to have had a history of plagiarism allegations, with others alleging his early design plagiarised work of Jan Tschichold, and that he used a photo without permission in promotional materials for the emblem, along with other past cases. On 1 September 2015, following an emergency meeting of TOCOG, the Governor of Tokyo Yōichi Masuzoe announced that they had decided to scrap Sano's two logos. The committee met the following day to develop a new logo design.On 24 November 2015, an Emblems Selection Committee was established to organize an open call for design proposals, open to Japanese residents over the age of 18, with a deadline set for 7 December 2015. The winner would receive ¥1 million and tickets to the opening ceremonies of both the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. On 8 April 2016, a new shortlist of four pairs of designs for Olympic and Paralympic emblems were unveiled by the Emblems Selection Committee; the Committee's selection—with input from a public poll—was presented to TOCOG on 25 April 2016 for final approval.The new emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016. Designed by Asao Tokolo, winner of the nationwide design contest, the emblems take the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design is meant to ""express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan"".",566
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Stadium design plagiarism,"After Tokyo submitted their bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics, there was talk of possibly renovating or reconstructing the National Olympic Stadium. The stadium would host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as track and field events.In February 2012, it was confirmed that the stadium would be demolished and reconstructed, and receive a £1 billion upgrade. In November 2012, renderings of the new national stadium were revealed, based on a design by British architect Zaha Hadid. The stadium was demolished in 2015 and the new one was originally scheduled to be completed in March 2019. The new stadium would be the venue for athletics, rugby, some football games, and the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics and Paralympics.In May 2015, due to budget constraints, the Japanese government announced several changes to Hadid's design, including cancelling plans to build a retractable roof, and converting some permanent seating to temporary seating. The area of the site was also reduced from 71 to 52 acres. Several prominent Japanese architects, including Toyo Ito and Fumihiko Maki, criticized Hadid's design, with Ito comparing it to a turtle and Maki calling it a white elephant. Others criticized the stadium's encroachment on the outer gardens of the Meiji Shrine. Arata Isozaki said that he was ""shocked to see that the dynamism present in the original had gone"" in the redesign of Hadid's original plan.After the futuristic Olympic stadium design by Zaha Hadid was ditched for cost-related reasons, a new design by the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma faced plagiarism accusations due to its similarities to Hadid's original blueprint. Kuma admitted that there were similarities, but denied copying the work of Hadid.",360
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Environmental degradation,"Contrary to the claim to be an ""eco-friendly"" Olympic Games, mass logging for the 2020 games became an issue, triggering concerns and protests from citizens and environmental organizations. Domestically, a large number of trees and shrubs in parks were cut down for venue construction and discarded as waste. Some logging was done without notifying the Ainu tribe in Hokkaido, and was reported not to meet the criteria of timber procurement. Instances of logging and procurement for the games, mainly in rainforests in Malaysia and Indonesia, received international criticism. Many believed that the logging infringed on the rights of residents, and 140,000 people signed a petition against deforestation. 47 organizations applied to stop the IOC from procuring timber, claiming that the Tokyo games would become a symbol of environmental destruction and violations of human rights. In Borneo, a local chief petitioned to stop timber procurement in his village.In addition, one of the companies that provided timber for construction of the new national stadium and Ariake Arena has been suspected of illegal logging for 20 years.",219
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,COVID-19 pandemic and other contagion risks,"The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic was a concern for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which took place at the end of July 2021. Due to the Olympics, the Japanese government took extra precautions to help control the country's ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. The Tokyo organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee were closely monitoring COVID-19 cases in Tokyo leading up to the Olympics, in order to determine if the games could be held safely.Leading up to the Olympics, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provided vaccinations for the large portions of the Japanese population still unprotected from common infectious diseases. For example, Japan has no mandatory mumps vaccination and is fourth in the world in mumps cases, after China, Nepal and Burkina Faso, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO).Following the outbreaks of rubella in Japan, which prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to warn pregnant women against traveling to Japan in 2018, the country's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted inoculations of middle-aged men who did not receive a rubella vaccination in the 1970s and 1980s.In a February 2020 interview with City A.M., the Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former London 2012 Olympic venues, should the Games need to be moved due to the ongoing disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticised Bailey's comment as inappropriate. On 3 March, the organisers said that the Olympics would go on as planned.On 20 March 2020, the World Anti Doping Agency noted that the coronavirus outbreak was seriously affecting doping tests in advance of the games. The IOC regulations required extensive testing in the months prior to the event. China had temporarily stopped testing in February, and the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced testing by March. European anti-doping agencies raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed, and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk.On 24 March 2020, due to the rapidly-spreading COVID-19 pandemic across Europe, Africa, and the Americas, the Summer Olympics were postponed to 2021, still to be held in Tokyo.There was speculation that the Japanese government was suppressing the extent of the infection, to make sure that the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games would be held on schedule. Former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama suggested that the number of confirmed cases was downplayed by the Japanese government in order to preserve the Olympics as scheduled, adding that Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike put the 2020 Olympics, rather than Tokyo citizens, first. The country saw a sudden rise in COVID-19 cases after the postponement was announced, but health minister Katsunobu Kato denied the rumour that the postponement of the Olympics was tied to the spike in confirmed cases.In April, Will Ripley, a correspondent for CNN, said that in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Japanese government was fighting to save the Olympics, as other countries were taking aggressive measures to fight COVID-19. He also mentioned that the confirmed COVID-19 cases suddenly increased after the postponement of the Olympics was announced, pointing out that Japan's approach kept cases low, so that the Japanese government could save the Olympics.In May 2021, a group of health experts warned that the Tokyo Games, without adopting a practical risk-management approach, could end up with widespread transmission. Pointing out the fact that ""adolescents between 15 and 17 years of age cannot be vaccinated in most countries, and children younger than 15 can be vaccinated in even fewer countries"", they discussed the possibility that without regular testing, participants, especially teenage athletes, ""could become infected during the Olympics and pose a risk when they return home to more than 200 countries"".Under guarantee G5.2 of the Contractual Framework for Hosting Olympic and Paralympic Games, the host country has the legal obligation to take all necessary measures to ensure that their Olympic-related activities should comply with any international agreements with regard to safety and health. However, in July 2020 the Japanese government promoted the ""GO TO TRAVEL"" campaign, a domestic travel campaign in order to mitigate the devastating impacts of the coronavirus on the Japanese economy. In January 2021, researchers at Kyoto University showed that the tourism campaign contributed to a sharp increase in COVID infection cases in the country. While the Japanese government said that there was no evidence that the campaign was linked to the surge in coronavirus infections, another study which was published in December 2020 showed a higher incidence of COVID-19 symptoms among those who had participated in the travel campaign.A poll conducted prior to the beginning of the Olympics reported that 83% of Japanese people were in favour of the cancellation of the games. 
However, Japan's Prime Minister did not allow the public to influence the government's decision of whether or not the games should be held.
Despite a rapid increase in COVID-19 detections, Thomas Bach noted that the increase has nothing to do with the Olympics itself. IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said the games would not be cancelled even if public opinion to cancel the games had grown. As reports of increase in COVID-19 cases came into light, Adams stated that ""we are not responsible and the increase of positives are happening in a parallel world"".The National Institute of Infectious Diseases reported a detection of the Lambda variant, the first case in Japan, at an airport testing facility on 20 July but did not initially announce it to the public. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said, in answer The Daily Beast's interview question, that they were waiting to announce it to the public, at the end of the Olympic games. Later, the infected person was revealed to be a staff member of the Olympic games, and Masahisa Sato said, in an interview, that they did not reveal the detection of the Lambda variant until 6 August because there were no enquiries until that day.To prevent the spread of COVID-19, athletes were restricted from going out. In particular, athletes who tested positive for COVID-19 and were quarantined in hotels complained that it was like a prison. The Tokyo Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was criticized by some for not disclosing the nationality or gender of athletes for privacy reasons, although it disclosed the number of athletes infected and the date.",1339
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Fukushima radiation,"The Tokyo Organising Committee announced that the Olympics torch relay would begin in Fukushima, and the Olympic baseball and softball matches would be played at Fukushima Azuma Baseball Stadium, 55 miles (89 km) from the site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, despite the fact that the scientific studies on the safety of Fukushima were currently in dispute. Regarding the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, a major, level-7 nuclear accident that resulted in multiple nuclear meltdowns, officials from the WHO and the United Nations determined that the risks of dangerous radiation exposure were minimal. Nevertheless, some scientists and citizens remained skeptical.For example, Tilman Ruff, a public health expert and a co-founder of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), urged the Australian Olympic Committee to properly inform its staff and athletes attending the 2020 Tokyo Games about the ongoing health effects of the Fukushima radiation.Former nuclear industry executive and whistle blower Arnold Gundersen and his institute, Fairewinds Associates, tested for the presence of radioactive dust on land scheduled to be used for certain events, including baseball, softball, and the Olympic torch relay. At these facilities, the legally allowable radiation levels were higher than at other athletic facilities. According to certain models, such as the National Academy of Sciences' ""linear, no-threshold"" model, small increases in radiation exposure may cause proportional health risks. The Japanese government posted that measured radiation levels in the city of Fukushima were comparable with safe readings in Hong Kong and Seoul, while Tokyo's readings are even lower, in line with Paris and London. However, the data collected by the monitoring posts installed by the Japanese governments were partial and non-representative of the extent of radioactive contamination, as they measured only the atmospheric radiation levels in the form of gamma rays, but not radionuclides, such as cesium-137, which emit alpha and beta particles that are dangerous when inhaled or ingested. It was also pointed out that the government-installed monitoring posts were placed strategically and the areas surrounding the posts were cleaned so that the radiation levels remained lower. Greenpeace reported that the radiation levels measured around the J-Village sports camp in Fukushima, where the Tokyo 2020 Olympic torch relay would begin, were 1,700 times higher than before the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Even though the Japanese government promised radiation levels below 0.23 µSv per hour, radiation hot spots at the J-Village showed readings as high as 1.7 µSv per hour at 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) above the surface and over 71 µSv per hour at surface level.In October 2019, after tons of poorly-secured radioactive Fukushima waste were swept away by typhoon Hagibis, IOC chief Thomas Bach promised to carry out inspections on radiation safety.In November 2019, a Japanese citizens' group Minna-No Data Site (Everyone's Data Site) published an English version of the Citizens' Radiation Data Map of Japan, a 16-page booklet featuring radiation-level maps, created using soil samples from 3,400 sites in 17 prefectures in eastern Japan, the results of three-year land contamination surveys with approximately 4,000 volunteers.Additionally, as of 2019, food from the region, under import restrictions in 23 countries, has been tested intensively for safety.
During the Olympics, the South Korean team provided its own food service for the team, claiming that the food served in the Olympic village might be contaminated with radiation. South Korea's Kukmin Ilbo also claimed that the bouquet presented to medalists may also have been contaminated with radiation. In response to these South Korean claims, the governor of Fukushima Prefecture, Masao Uchibori, claimed that ""Currently, Japan's standards for radioactive materials are the strictest in the world, and all foods and plants have passed the inspection. People should correct misunderstandings and prejudices based on correct information."" A Japanese government official said, ""Their claims have no scientific basis and they are insulting people in the Fukushima area. The Japanese government should urge the IOC to warn South Korea.""",838
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Hot weather and air-conditioning,"Tokyo's bid to host the Summer Olympics played down concerns over heat, with the proposal reading ""With many days of mild and sunny weather, this period provides an ideal climate for athletes to perform at their best"". However, the 2020 Olympics were expected to be the hottest Olympics ever, due to Tokyo's hot summer climate (the 1964 Summer Olympics were held in October to avoid the heat), the urban heat island effect and climate change.In October 2019, the International Olympic Committee announced plans for moving the Olympic marathon and race walking to Sapporo, more than 800 kilometres (500 mi) north of Tokyo, in a bid to avoid the heat. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government strongly opposed the IOC's decision, suggesting, instead, to move the marathon start time up one hour to 5:00 a.m., while Sapporo welcomed the IOC announcement. In October 2019, Japanese politician Shigefumi Matsuzawa wrote to IOC chief Thomas Bach to move the Olympic golf tournaments, scheduled to take place at Kasumigaseki Golf Club in Saitama Prefecture, about 50 kilometres (31 mi) northwest of Tokyo, to a region with fewer heat problems.Concern over indoor temperatures was also raised, since, for cost reduction, Tokyo's New National Stadium was built without an air conditioner, and the roof was constructed over the spectator seating only. Additionally, a sports museum and sky walkway that were part of the scrapped design were eliminated, while VIP lounges and seats were reduced, along with reduced underground parking facilities. These reductions resulted in a site of 198,500 square meters, 13% less than originally planned. Air conditioning for the stadium was also abandoned upon request of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe; and when asked about the abandonment, Minister for the Olympics Toshiaki Endo stated that ""Air conditioners are installed in only two stadiums around the world, and they can only cool temperatures by 2 or 3°C"".In December 2019, the Asahi Shimbun reported that, due to the dangers of hyperthermia, 206 primary schools in 24 out of 50 wards in Tokyo Prefecture had given up their tickets to the Olympic and Paralympic games, among those tickets allotted by the government to schoolchildren. Also, 101 additional schools told Asahi that they were considering giving up their tickets. According to the report, more than 70% of the private primary schools in Tokyo were planning to refrain from taking students to the Olympic and Paralympic games.On 23 July 2021, Russian archer Svetlana Gomboeva collapsed due to heat after the qualifying Olympic round. She recovered after being promptly assisted by the medical staff and by the American, British and Italian teams' doctors.Daniil Medvedev and Novak Djokovic suggested that organisers should delay the start times of tennis matches until the evening to avoid the hottest parts of the day, when temperatures hovered around 33 degrees Celsius. On 28 July 2021, Medvedev asked the umpire who would be responsible if he died during his Olympic tennis match. Paula Badosa, who got through to the quarter final, was forced to withdraw from the competition because she suffered heatstroke in the extremely hot weather.",652
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Water quality and temperatures,"The sea off the Odaiba Marine Park in Tokyo Bay, the venue for the Olympic and Paralympic triathlons, was reported to contain high levels of faecally-derived coliform bacteria.On 17 August 2019, the Paratriathlon World Cup, scheduled at the venue, was cancelled due to a high concentration of E. coli bacteria in the water. In the same year, some triathletes who competed in the world triathlon mixed-relay event at the park complained about the water's foul odor, saying that it ""smelt like a lavatory"". Scientists also urged the Olympic organisers to abandon the venue. In the same month, Ous Mellouli, Yumi Kida, and other athletes, who participated an Olympic open water test event in Odaiba Marine Park, expressed their concerns over water temperature, odor, and clarity. Water temperature during the event was at 30.9 °C (87.6 °F), barely inside of acceptable range for official competition by FINA: 16–31 °C (61–88 °F).In December 2019, the USA Olympic Open Water Team head coach Catherine Kase and the American Swimming Coaches Association (ASCA) asked the open water venue to be moved out of Tokyo to safer waters. Saying that they ""are not comfortable with the Odaiba venue"", the US swimmers and coaches called for a viable back-up plan for the open-water venue, in case swimming in Tokyo Bay was not safe due to environmental factors, such as near-danger levels of water temperatures (averaging 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) in summer 2019) and water quality issues, including E. coli bacteria and water transparency problems.In February 2020, swimmer Haley Anderson voiced her concerns for the compromised water quality from E. coli, unsafe water temperature (84–86 °F (29–30 °C)), and lack of a plan-B venue for the Tokyo Olympics, saying that the swimmers ""have spoken out and gone unheard so far"". She also added that she was ""not confident in FINA or the IOC to have the same concern for the athletes"".",448
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Asbestos in Olympic venues,"Asbestos, a well-known health hazard that is prohibited from being used as a building material in many countries, including Japan, was found at the Tokyo Tatsumi International Swimming Center, where the Olympic water polo events would take place. In 2017, when the asbestos was first found, in fireproof material sprayed on part of the structure supporting the swimming centre's roof, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government decided to leave it, deeming that the small amount of the mineral present would not be accessible to visitors. In 2019, after media coverage, the organisers promised to take ""emergency countermeasures"" to solve the problem, without specifying what actions would be taken.",139
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Tropical Storm Nepartak,"Due to the weather effects from Tropical Storm Nepartak, certain sports' schedules were disrupted. The start of the women's triathlon was delayed, while surfing events were moved a day ahead to take advantage of the waves. The schedule of archery events was also affected. The rowing competitions were rescheduled as well. In addition, staff members were seen removing umbrellas in preparation for the approaching storm to avoid their being blown away.",94
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Damage of rooms by Australian athletes,"Near the end of the Olympics, it was reported that Australian athletes had damaged the village rooms before departure, leaving a pool of vomit on the floor, damaged beds, and a hole in the wall. Australian rugby Olympians also reportedly became drunk on the flight to Sydney, leaving vomit in the plane bathroom and receiving complaints from other passengers. Team Australia chief Ian Chesterman played down the incidents, and said that the Olympians would not be punished.",96

Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Worker rights,"In 2017, the suicide of a Tokyo Olympic stadium worker was linked to overwork, according to Japanese labor inspectors. The 23-year-old man in charge of quality control of materials at the stadium construction site was found to have recorded 211 hours and 56 minutes of overtime in one month before he killed himself in March. In September, inspectors found illegal overwork in almost 40 companies, 18 of which had employees working overtime of more than 80 hours per month, and several of them exceeding 150 hours. According to the Building and Wood Workers' International (BWI) report on worker safety, ""dangerous patterns of overwork"", including cases of working up to 28 consecutive days, were found at Tokyo Olympic construction sites. Construction workers, many of whom were foreign migrant workers, were reported to have been discouraged from reporting poor working conditions, and some workers were required to purchase their protective equipment.In December 2017, Mitsubishi Electric, an official partner of the 2020 Olympic games, locked 1,800 workers out of a Thailand factory. The workers were members of a trade union affiliated with the Confederation of Thai Electrical Appliances, Electronic Automobile & Metalworkers. The company then forced workers to attend eleven days of humiliating training at a military camp and cleaning old people's homes, among other chores, and forced them to publicly apologise to the company on social media. Most of the workers were reinstated in January 2018. IndustriALL Global Union condemned the harassment and filed a complaint with the Tokyo Organising Committee.",304
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Acknowledgement of disputed territories,"Russian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (territory claimed by Japan but governed by South Korea) and the Kuril Islands (territory claimed by Japan but governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan. Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, described the inclusion as ""illegal"", and accused the Tokyo Organising Committee of ""politicising"" the Games.Chinese diplomats took issue with the Taiwanese team being introduced as “Taiwan"" instead of Chinese Taipei.",130
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Rising Sun Flag,"The South Korean government called for a ban of the usage the Rising Sun Flag, due to the flag's being considered offensive, as a consequence of its usage by the Imperial Japanese military during World War II, as well as its current use by controversial nationalist groups in Japan, such as Zaitokukai. The flag, which has been compared by many to the Nazi swastika, the US Confederate flag in modern times, and the Apartheid flag of South Africa, is associated with war crimes and atrocities committed under the Empire of Japan, as well as contemporary Japan's far-right nationalist attempts to revise, deny, or romanticise its imperialistic past.The flag is currently banned by FIFA, and Japan was sanctioned by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) after Japanese fans flew it at an AFC Champions League match in 2017.In September 2019, the South Korean parliamentary committee for sports asked the organisers of 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo to ban the Rising Sun Flag, and the Chinese Civil Association for Claiming Compensation from Japan sent a letter to the International Olympic Committee asking it to ban the flag.According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea's request, saying, ""sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case by case basis.""On 8 August, the final day of the Tokyo Olympics, the South Korean Olympic Committee announced, ""The IOC has declared in a letter that the Rising Sun Flag violates the Olympic Charter. It will be banned at the Olympics."" South Korea said that the event proceeded without any diplomatic incidents between South Korea and Japan, and that the country was successful in having the IOC ban Japan's Rising Sun flag from the event. In response, the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic Games announced on 9 August, ""The announcement by the South Korean Olympic Committee is not true. When we contacted the IOC, we confirmed that the IOC will continue to respond to the issue on a case-by-case basis and will not impose a blanket ban. On the morning of 9 August, the IOC had sent a letter to South Korea indicating that the use of the flag will be determined on a case-by-case basis.""",454
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,South Korean team banner,"The South Korean team hung a banner off of the balcony in their section of the Olympic village that had the message ""I still have the support of 50 million Korean people"". This was adapted from the words of the Korean naval admiral Yi Sun-sin who said ""I still have 12 battleships left."" prior to pulling off a crucial victory against the 16th century Japanese invasion of the Korean Peninsula. After a Japanese protest and the IOC warning that it was provocative and a violation of the Olympic Charter, the South Korean team removed the banner. According to the South Korean Olympic Committee, the IOC would apply the same rules if the Rising Sun Flag is raised.",137
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Prohibition of political gestures,"The IOC published three pages of guidelines prohibiting athletes from using political gestures, such as kneeling, hand gestures, and disrespect during medal ceremonies. They were allowed to express political views on traditional and social media, and in interviews outside the Olympic Village. The decision came under fire, with critics pointing out that the IOC itself is not politically neutral, citing Adolf Hitler's actions during the 1936 Summer Olympics and the IOC's efforts to be granted UN Observer status during the Cold War, among other instances. Tennis legend Martina Navratilova tweeted, ""God how I despise these Olympic politician opportunists. I wouldn't last one day on one of these committees...""In early May 2021, the IOC announced that they would ban athletes who wear apparel sporting the Black Lives Matter slogan at the Tokyo Olympics.",162
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Mobilisation of students for the Olympics,"Criticism that students were being compelled to attend the Olympic Games was directed at the policy that students in Japanese schools whose principals had decided to accept the allocated Olympic and Paralympic tickets for school students were expected to be treated as absent from school if they did not attend the games.

So from time to time, like Brazil, I think it's good to have a venue for the first time. But Islamic countries, the only thing they share in common is Allah and they are fighting with each other and they have classes"".As criticizing rival bids is prohibited under IOC rules, Inose's statement was viewed as a violation, and received international criticism.

Despite Mori's reassignment, Seiko Hashimoto, who succeeded Mori as president of the committee, triggered controversy over the same topic due to her previous conduct. Mori also noted that he wanted a ""pure Japanese male"" to be the final runner of the torch relay instead of Naomi Osaka.

Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Kentaro Kobayashi: Past Holocaust jokes,"On 21 July 2021, Japanese media reported that Kentarō Kobayashi, who became the director of the opening and closing ceremonies after Sasaki resigned, utilized The Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, and that he made malicious and anti-Semitic jokes, and jokes about the Holocaust, including ""Let's play Jews genocide game (Let's play Holocaust)."" The Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC), a Jewish human rights organization, immediately issued a statement of condemnation to the anti-Semitic jokes. On 22 July, the day before the opening ceremony, the Organizing Committee announced its decision to dismiss Kobayashi.On the eve of the opening ceremony, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee, described Kobayashi's jokes as ""outrageous and unacceptable"", but also said that the opening ceremony planned by Kobayashi should proceed.In response to this situation, comedian Naoto Takenaka said he wouldn't attend the opening ceremony, citing his past joke about disabled people.

Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Appointment and resignation of Keigo Oyamada,"On 14 July 2021, the Organizing Committee announced the creative team for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics and Paralympics, and appointed Keigo Oyamada, of Cornelius, as a composer of the opening ceremony. It caused a growing number of people on social media to state that he should be ineligible to occupy such a role because he is widely known for his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome. He had inflicted horrific abuse on his peers when at school: such as forcing them to eat their excrement, masturbate in front of other students, etc. He himself often unapologetically told the disability abuse stories in interviews. On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, the Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, whose insight and good sense was questioned, reiterated their support for him as a composer and that they would not change their decision for the ceremonies. Toshirō Mutō, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, said he wanted Oyamada to remain involved. However, growing criticism forced Oyamada to announce his resignation on 19 July.",237
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Absence of foreign leaders,"Due to various reasons, such as the global reach of coronavirus variants, many leaders outside Japan announced that they would not attend the ceremonies of this event.

Sy wrote that he was questioned by the Tokyo Organising Committee, ""Why [an] African is here to perform?"" Additionally, Sy said about the Organising Committee, ""It's totally racist"".

On 23 July, the day of the opening ceremony, some media reported his claim. At a regular press conference held the next morning, Masanori Takaya, a spokesperson of the organising committee, said Sy's claim differed from the facts, and said ""We had planned a music part in which many singers would participate, but due to infectious disease control and budget, we canceled the part itself. Therefore we canceled the appearance of all the participants in the music part. That is the background of that story.""",178
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Music composed by Koichi Sugiyama,"At the opening ceremony, the theme music from Dragon Quest was used as a part of the Parade of Nations. The Daily Beast, an American news website, posted an article criticizing this, because the composer of the music, Koichi Sugiyama, was also known for his denial of Japan's use of comfort women, his opposition to LGBTQ rights, and his extreme nationalism. There had also been concern about the image that would be presented in the Japanese press before the Games.",103
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,"Yasushi Akimoto, a member of the Olympics organising committee: Girl groups, misogyny","In 2016, the Japanese girl group HKT48 released the single ""74 Okubun no 1 no Kimi e"", with a B-side called ""Einstein yori Dianna Agron"", written by Yasushi Akimoto. Comparing scientist Albert Einstein's intelligence and actress Dianna Agron's charm, the song was widely criticized as misogynistic in tone and message and as insulting to Agron. Some commentators, including The Japan Times, were critical of the fact that Akimoto, who at the time was on the Games' organising committee, would be allowed to represent the nation to the world.The choice of Akimoto as producer had been controversial when he was announced in 2014, as he suggested using his girl group AKB48 as the musical act in the ceremony, with various Japanese media personalities saying that to do so would be a shameful representation. A petition was started to remove him from the organising committee due to him contributing to the ""decline"" of the Japanese entertainment industry.

While his shirt displayed his name and ""Hong Kong, China"" on the back according to regulations, it was claimed that the colour of his shirt was related to the dominant colour of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. Additionally, the missing Bauhinia emblem on his shirt also became a subject of criticism, despite Hong Kong government regulations requiring that any emblems were to be approved by the chief executive. Ng responded, on Instagram, that his shirt sponsorship arrangement with Yonex, also worn by his badminton teammates, had expired just prior to the games, and he had to seek out an alternative on short notice. His shirt did not violate IOC guidelines, according to the Hong Kong Olympic Committee.Also criticized was as an error on Ng's replacement shirt, bearing an incorrect bauhinia flower on the regional flag. That version of the regional flag emblem was passed by the National People's Congress in 1990, and was not the modified version specified by the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance of 1997. According to the Ming Pao newspaper, this error was rectified by the Hong Kong Badminton Association and stated that the sponsor (Yonex) would issue new, revised jerseys to the remaining players, Tang Chun Man and Tse Ying Suet, competing in the mixed doubles bronze medal match.",336
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Venezuelan medalist phone calls,"After winning their medals, each of Venezuela's four medalists were obliged to speak on the phone with president Nicolás Maduro. According to Venezuelan media, the statements in the calls were guided by Venezuelan officials who were supervising each of the medalists. Political scientists have noted that the Venezuelan government used Olympic success as a form of propaganda.Venezuela's first medal of the Games was won by weightlifter Julio Mayora on 28 July, a silver medal that he dedicated (in his phone call) to late president Hugo Chávez, who had been born on 28 July. Noticiero Digital reported that, in the video, Venezuelan Youth and Sport Minister Mervin Maldonado can be heard in the background instructing him to do so. Mayora was attacked on social media in Venezuela for the dedication, as politics in that nation are controversial. The next day, Maduro took to national television to defend Mayora as a patriot and say that the nation's sporting ""generation of gold"" started with Chávez. El Pitazo interviewed Venezuelan Olympic cyclist Daniel Dhers about the controversy, with Dhers saying that, regardless of politics, everyone is at the Games for Venezuela. There also was criticism of the other medalists: El Nacional negatively compared them to the ""dignified"" Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, gold medalist Yulimar Rojas, and, in particular, to the Cuban defector Orestes Lorenzo.",302
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Online abuse of athletes,"Chinese shooter Wang Luyao, who failed to qualify for the finals of women's air-rifle competition, was heavily abused online as several users called her out for losing, after she apologised for her loss on Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo by posting a selfie captioned ""Sorry everyone, I admit I chickened out. See you in three years."" The backlash to Wang's post became a top trend on Weibo, forcing her to delete her post. As a result of the online abuse, Weibo announced that accounts of 33 users were banned temporarily and 35 hate comments were deleted. In response to the trolls, a counter-trend of hashtag ""Wang Luyao is still Zhejiang's good girl"" later emerged on Chinese social media, as people rallied support for her, and state media China Daily published an editorial piece in support of Wang and shaming her bullies.Singaporean swimmer Joseph Schooling, who failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the 100m swimming event, received numerous negative and hurtful comments following his loss. In response, Singaporean president Halimah Yacob came to Schooling's defense and urged Singaporeans to support their national athletes.

Their criticism was met with backlash from supporters of Biles and a wider American society, as well as prominent TV pundits, on CNN and elsewhere.South Korean athlete An San, who won triple gold, was criticized and abused by South Korean anti-feminists online who called her a ""short-haired feminist"" and asked officials to take back her gold medal. The online hate and abuse was due to the rising antifeminist sentiments among South Korean youth.Some Japanese athletes who beat Chinese athletes were abused online by some Chinese nationalists on Instagram, Twitter, and Weibo. Some Chinese nationalists questioned the scoring of Daiki Hashimoto, who won the gold medal in the men's artistic individual all-around of gymnastics, as he received a higher score than Xiao Ruoteng on the vault, despite stepping off the mat on the landing. They tagged Hashimoto's Instagram account with pictures of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In response, the International Gymnastics Federation announced details of Hashimoto's scoring and made it clear that it was correct. Some Chinese nationalists also sent many messages, wishing for their deaths, to the SNS accounts of Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito, who won gold medals in mixed doubles table tennis. In response, Katsunobu Katō, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Japanese government, said, ""The bullying goes against the spirit of the Tokyo Olympics.""Chinese table tennis players Liu Shiwen and Xu Xin, who lost to Mima Ito and Jun Mizutani, were attacked online by Chinese nationalists saying they had ""failed the nation"", while making unsubstantiated claims of referee bias in favor of Ito and Mizutani.

Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,False claims of additional doping tests,"On 26 July, Indian news outlet ANI wrongly reported that Hou Zhihui of China, the new 49 kg weightlifting champion, would be tested by the International Testing Agency (ITA) for doping, according to ANI's unnamed source. Zhihui had won gold in the 49 kg women's weightlifting event, against India's Mirabai Chanu, who won silver. The article also stated that Chanu would be upgraded to a gold medal if the tests were positive. This report was subsequently propagated across other news networks, including The Economic Times, Business Standard, India.com and Taiwan News. The World Anti-Doping Agency and ITA debunked the reports, saying they knew nothing of such tests being carried out and that any developments would be transparently reported on their site. On 30 July, ANI reported that no such test had occurred, and that they had made an ""inadvertent error while reporting the news"".

Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Russian reaction to the results of the women's all-around rhythmic gymnastics,"The result of the women's rhythmic gymnastics competition was controversial in Russia, as Israeli gold medalist Linoy Ashram had dropped her apparatus during her ribbon routine. The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) claimed that she did not receive a significant deduction, which would have changed the standings due to the narrow score difference between Ashram and Russian silver medalist Dina Averina. Meanwhile, Olympic judges and supporters of Ashram noted that Ashram's combined overall difficulty was over a point higher than Averina's, allowing Ashram to score well even with a 1 point deduction for dropping the apparatus.After the results were in, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) coaches submitted an inquiry on Dina Averina's ribbon score, but the score was unchanged. Averina commented that she believed the judges were supporting Ashram and punishing her, and she considered herself the champion. This position was universally supported by the Russian state-controlled media, which stated that Averina was the victim of ""political games"" and was purposefully denied gold, referring it to ""the conspiracy against Russia"".",240
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Medal count controversy,"American media outlets were criticised on social media for publishing a medal table that ranked countries by total medals won, rather than using the IOC standard of ranking NOCs by gold, then silver, then bronze – but this was nothing new, as it had been the practice of many American media outlets for decades. For instance, the Washington Post placed China second in the 2016 Summer Olympics medal table based on total medals (Great Britain placed second in the gold medal count that is used by most international sources). However, there were some notable exceptions, such as The New York Times switching from total medals in 2012 to gold medals in 2016. Some fans accused American websites of bias, because Team USA was leading the medal count by total medals throughout the entire Games but only topped the gold medal count on the last day of the competition.In Russia, the gold medal count has always held a predominant role, and the state broadcaster Match TV used it during the 2016 Summer Olympics and midway during the 2020 Summer Olympics. However, closer to the finish of the Olympics, when it became apparent that Russian athletes would only finish fifth in the medal table, Match TV switched to using the overall medal count, where Russia was third.After the United States overtook China in the gold medal table on the last day of the competition, Andrew Reid of Yahoo Sport Australia and Sam Cooper of Business Insider cited an unverified Chinese state media post on social media showing China coming first in the medal count by adding Hong Kong's and Taiwan's (competing as Chinese Taipei) medals to China's total, even though Hong Kong and Taiwan have separate NOCs.",328

The embassy also condemned a News.com.au article cited by the BBC. The statement said that ""The reports on the BBC Chinese website and news.com.au about the participation of 'Chinese Taipei' in Tokyo Olympics are unprofessional and severely misleading. The Chinese side is gravely concerned and strongly opposes this."" On 4 August, the embassy again criticized the BBC's coverage of Taiwan's participation in the Olympics, saying that a BBC article explaining the history of Taiwan's Olympic moniker ""Chinese Taipei"" had been ""sensationalizing the question of the 'Chinese Taipei' team at the Tokyo Olympics."" and went on to state ""[China] strongly urges these media to follow international consensus and professional conduct, to stop politicizing sports, and to stop interference with the Tokyo Olympic games.""",229
Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Chinese diplomacy,"Chinese diplomats engaged in wolf warrior diplomacy during the Olympics, with issue being taken with the way Chinese athletes were being depicted by the media.

The consulate took to Twitter, writing ""Using a wrong map of #China is a real lack of common sense. Politicizing sports and violating the Olympics Charter spirits will only do harm to the #Olympic Games and the relationship between the #Chinese and the #Americans.""Chinese diplomats took issue with CNN's coverage of China's first gold medal, when CNN published a headline saying ""Gold for China…and more COVID-19 cases"".",175

Rome bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,Rome 2020 (Italian: Roma 2020) was a proposed bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics by the city of Rome and the Italian National Olympic Committee. Rome had previously hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics. The bid for the 2020 Games was withdrawn due to the lack of support from the Italian government.,62
Rome bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics,History,"The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) announced the selection of Rome as Italy's candidate city on May 19, 2010. Rome was selected ahead of Venice which was deemed unable to fulfill requirements set by the IOC for hosting the Games; among other things, it relied too heavily on venues outside the city, including in Treviso and Padua. The initial Rome proposal included a $61 million bid budget and a plan to utilize 70 percent of existing venues.Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo, who ran the 1990 FIFA World Cup, was asked to lead the bid committee, but turned down the offer. Entrepreneur Nerio Alessandri was also offered the job but he too declined. IOC vice president Mario Pescante was chosen instead. His appointment was cleared by the IOC Ethics Committee, which found no conflict of interest. In an interview with media outlet Around the Rings, Pescante acknowledged competition from other potential bid cities, particularly emphasizing Tokyo's bid.In a September 2011 interview, IOC President Jacques Rogge defended Rome's and Madrid's ability to host the 2020 Olympics in spite of the ongoing eurozone debt crisis. He pointed out that both cities already had a lot of venues in place and not much would need to be built. He continued by saying that, at the very most, some venues would need to be upgraded but that both cities had the necessary infrastructure to host the Games. Rome's bid was given full backing by the Italian government on February 22, 2011. The bid had an initial budget of €31 million. The chairman of the bid committee, Mario Pescante, stated that he hoped Rome's bid could serve as ""a blueprint for a return to fiscal responsibility and real sustainability in the Olympic bidding process"".On October 3, 2011, Rome 2020 announced that they had hired marketing firm Helios Partners as a consultant for their bid. The firm had a track record of assisting in the successful bids of several Olympic host cities. (Two months after Rome withdrew their bid, Helios Partners was signed as a consultant to Baku's 2020 bid.) On October 11, 2011, the bid committee hired Coni Servizi Engineering and Consulting as their lead technical partner with the remit of assisting the bid committee with their venue master plan.In November 2011, ""GiovaniRoma2020"" (YouthRome2020) was launched to help promote the bid as well as promoting youth olympic education. The following month, the bid received the support of the country's environment ministry; Environment Minister Corrado Clini stated that the bid needed to be environmentally sustainable to boost its chances of success. The bid was also supported by Italy's Chamber of Deputies.In January 2012, the Rome 2020 bid committee estimated that the cost of organizing the Games would be €9.8 billion but hosting the Games would lead to a growth of €17.7 billion (a 1.4% increase) in Italian GDP, with the creation of 29,000 jobs. The public cost would be €4.6 billion and hosting the Games would bring in €4.6 billion in tax revenue. By January 2012, there was high public support for the bid amongst Italian citizens, with 74% of Italians supporting the bid and 77% of Rome residents in support. Of those polled who supported the bid, 70% were in favor because they believed that hosting the Olympics would create economic benefits and jobs.On February 14, 2012, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called an end to the bid, citing uncertain costs and unknown financial benefit. The announcement came a day before the deadline for applicant cities to submit the application files.",738

Since four Japanese climbers qualified during this event (two male, two female), the unused Host Country Place went to the next highest placed climber in the Combined World Championships who is not yet qualified and doesn't come from a country with 2 climbers already qualified.The second opportunity, the Olympic Qualifying Event featured the next 22 ranked athletes in the World Cup standings who had not yet received an Olympic invitation; of these, the top six qualified for the Olympic Games.Between February and May 2020 each continent was to host a Continental Combined Championship, with the best finisher who is not already qualified earning a quota spot.

Pair skating,Summary,"Pair skating is a figure skating discipline defined by the International Skating Union (ISU) as ""the skating of two persons in unison who perform their movements in such harmony with each other as to give the impression of genuine Pair Skating as compared with independent Single Skating"".  The ISU also states that a pairs team must consist of ""one Lady and one Man"".  Pair skating, along with men's and women's single skating, has been an Olympic discipline since figure skating, the oldest Winter Olympic sport, was introduced at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. The ISU World Figure Skating Championships introduced pair skating in 1908.
Like the other disciplines, pair skating competitions consist of two segments, the short program and the free skating program.  There are seven required elements in the short program, which lasts 2 minutes and 40 seconds for both junior and senior pair teams.  Free skating for pairs ""consists of a well balanced program composed and skated to music of the pair's own choice for a specified period of time"".  It also should contain ""especially typical Pair Skating moves"" such as pair spins, lifts, partner assisted jumps, spirals and other similar moves, ""linked harmoniously by steps and other movements"".  Its duration, like the other disciplines, is 4 minutes for senior teams, and 3+1⁄2 minutes for junior teams.  Pair skating required elements include lifts, twist lifts, throw jumps, jumps, spin combinations, death spirals, step sequences, and choreographic sequences.  The elements performed by pairs teams must be ""linked together by connecting steps of a different nature"" and by other comparable movements and with a variety of holds and positions.  Pair skaters must only execute the prescribed elements; if they do not, the extra or unprescribed elements will not be counted in their score.  Violations in pair skating include falls, time, music, and clothing.
Pair skating is the most dangerous discipline in figure skating; it has been compared to playing in the National Football League.  Pair skaters have more injuries than skaters in other disciplines, and women pair skaters have more injuries than male pair skaters.",448
Pair skating,Beginnings,"The International Skating Union (ISU) defines pair skating as ""the skating of two persons in unison who perform their movements in such harmony with each other as to give the impression of genuine Pair Skating as compared with independent Single Skating"".  The ISU also states that a pairs team must consist of ""one Lady and one Man"" and that ""attention should be paid to the selection of an appropriate partner"".The roots of pairs skating, like ice dance, is in the ""combined skating"" developed in the 19th century by skating clubs and organizations and by recreational social skating between couples and friends, who would skate waltzes, marches, and other social dances together.  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, the rising popularity of skating during the 19th century led to the development of figure skating techniques, especially the ""various forms of hand-in-hand skating that would become the basis of pair skating"". Figure skating historian James R. Hines reported that factors, such as hand-in-hand skating and ""the crazelike fascination with ice dancing"" in the mid-1890s, contributed to the development of pair skating. Madge Syers, the first female figure skater to compete and win internationally, stated that from the beginning of the introduction of pair skating in international competitions, it was a popular sport for audiences to watch, and that ""if the pair are well matched and clever performers, it is undoubtedly the most attractive to watch"".  Syers stated that Viennese skaters were responsible for pair skating's popularity at the beginning of the 20th century. Syers also credited the Austrians for adding dance moves to pair skating.At first, pair skating consisted of executing basic figures and side-by-side free-skating moves, such as long, flowing spirals done backwards or forwards, and connected with dance steps while couples held one or two hands.  Jumps and pirouettes were not required, and were done by only experienced pair skaters.  German pair skater Heinrich Burger, in his article in Irving Brokaw's The Art of Skating (1915), stated that he and his partner, Anna Hübler, inserted figures skated by single skaters into ""our several dances according to the music"" until the figures became more complicated and developed into a different appearance; as Burger put it, ""the fundamental character of the figure, however, has remained the same"".  Also in the 1890s, combined and hand-in-hand skating moved skating away from ""the static confines of basic figures to continuous movement around a rink"".  Hines insisted that the popularity of skating waltzes, which depended upon the speed and flow across the ice of couples in dance positions and not just on holding hands with a partner, ""dealt a death knell to hand-in-hand skating"".",590
Pair skating,Early years,"Pair skating, along with men's and women's single skating, has been an Olympic discipline since figure skating, the oldest Winter Olympic sport, was introduced at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.  The ISU World Figure Skating Championships introduced pair skating, along with women's singles, also in 1908.   Hübler and Burger were the first Olympic gold medalists in pair skating in 1908; they also won the 1908 and 1910 World Championships.  In 1936, Maxi Herber and Ernst Baier won the gold medal at the Olympics and went on to win the World Championships from 1936 to 1939.  The first pair skating national competitions in Canada occurred in 1905 and the first time pair skating was included during a U.S. Championships was in 1914, but there are only a few descriptions of pair skating in North America before World War I.  Side-by-side skating, also called shadow skating, in which partners executed the same movements and steps in unison, were emphasized in the early 1920s.  Pair skating became more athletic in the 1930s; partners executed ""a balanced blend of shadow skating coupled with increasingly spectacular pair moves, including spins, death-spirals, and lifts"".  Hines credits German pair skaters Maxi Herber and Ernst Baier and French team Andrée Brunet and Pierre Brunet with developing athletic elements and programs that included pair spins, side-by-side spins, lifts, throw jumps, side-by-side jumps, and side-by-side footwork sequences.  By the 1930s, pair skating had advanced; Hines stated, ""It was not yet viewed equally with singles skating, at least from a technically standpoint, but it had grown to be a much-appreciated discipline"".  Hines also reported that many single skaters during the era also competed in pair skating.Soviet and Russian domination in pair skating began in the 1950s and continued throughout the rest of the 1900s.  Only five non-Soviet or Russian teams won the World Championships after 1965, until 2010.  Soviet pair teams won gold medals in seven consecutive Olympics, from 1964 in Innsbruck to 1988 in Calgary.  Kestnbaum credited the Soviets for emphasizing ballet, theater, and folk dance in all disciplines of figure skating, noting the influence of Soviet pair team  and married couple Liudmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov.  The Protopopovs, as they were called, won gold medals at the 1964 and 1968 Olympics, as well as the 1968 World Championships, ""raised by several degrees the level of translating classical dance to the ice"".  Hines reported that the Protopopovs represented a new style of pair skating developed during the 1960s.  He stated, ""A more flowing style presented by the Russians was replacing an older, more disconnected style"". The Protopopovs, like single skaters Sonja Henie in the 1930s and Dick Button in the 1940s, while winning multiple Olympic medals, ""altered dramatically the direction of figure skating"", and marked the beginning of the Soviet domination of pair skating for the rest of the 20th century.  Irina Rodnina, with her partner Alexei Ulanov and later Alexander Zaitsev, also from the Soviet Union, dominated pair skating throughout the 1970s and ""led the trend of female pair skaters as risk-taking athletes"".  With Ulanov, Rodnina won World and European titles for four years in a row and an Olympic gold medal in 1972.  Hines reported that Rodnina and her second partner, Zaitsev, won the 1973 European Championships and were ""never seriously challenged"" between 1974 and 1978, winning gold medals at the 1976 Olympics and at every World and European Championships during that period.  They also won gold medals at the 1980 European Championships and at the Olympics that same year.  Hines stated, about Rodnina and her partners, that they ""transformed pair skating through expanded and inspired athleticism"".",829
Pair skating,Later years,"Pair skating, which has never included a compulsory phase like the other figure skating disciplines, did not require a short program until the early 1960s, when the ISU ""instituted a short program of required moves"" as the first part of pair competitions.  Hines reported that the change was due ""to a few controversial decisions in the 1950s and the discipline's increasing technical complexities"".  In 1964, at the European Championships in Grenoble, France and the 1964 World Championships in Dortmund, West Germany, and during the Olympics in 1968, a two-and-a-half minute long technical program was added, later called the short program, which constituted one-third of a team's scores.  The arrangement of the specific moves, also unlike compulsory figures for single skaters and the compulsory dance for ice dancers, were up to each pair team.  The short programs introduced in single men and women competitions in 1973 were modeled after the pair skating short program, and the structure of competitions in both single and pair competitions have been identical since the elimination of compulsory figures in 1990.A judging scandal at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah ""ushered in sweeping reforms in the scoring system"" of figure skating competitions.  The scandal, which centered around Canadian pair team Jamie Sale and David Pelletier and Russian pair team Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, brought about the end of the 6.0 scoring system and the implementation of the ISU Judging System, starting in 2004.According to Caroline Silby, a consultant with U.S. Figure Skating, pair teams, as well as ice dance teams, have the added challenge of strengthening partnerships and ensuring that teams stay together for several years.  Silby states, ""Conflict between partners that is consistent and unresolved can often lead to the early demise or break-up of a team"".  Challenges for both pairs and dancers, which can make conflict resolution and communication difficult, include: the fewer number of available boys for girls to find partnerships; different priorities regarding commitment and scheduling; differences in partners' ages and developmental stages; differences in family situations; the common necessity of one or both partners moving to train at a new facility; and different skill levels when the partnership is formed.  Silby estimates that due to the lack of effective communication among pairs teams, there is a ""six-fold increase in the risk of national-level figure skating teams splitting"".  Teams with strong skills in communication and conflict resolution, however, tend to produce ""highest-placing finishers at national championship events"".",528
Pair skating,Short program,"The short program is the first segment of single skating, pair skating, and synchronized skating in international competitions, including all ISU championships, the Olympic Winter Games, the Winter Youth Games, qualifying competitions for the Olympic Winter Games, and ISU Grand Prix events for both junior and senior-level skaters (including the finals).  The short program must be skated before the free skate, the second component in competitions.  The short program lasts, for both senior and junior pair skaters, two minutes and 40 seconds.  Vocal music with lyrics has been allowed in pair skating and in all disciplines since the 2014–2015 season.Both junior and senior pair skaters have seven required elements: a lift, a twist lift, a  throw jump, a jump; a solo spin combination, a death spiral, and a step sequence. 
The sequence of the elements is optional.  Like single skaters, the short programs of pair teams must be skated in harmony with the music, which they choose.  The short program for pair skating was introduced at the 1963 European Championships, the 1964 World Championships, and the Olympics in 1968; previously, pair skaters only had to perform the free skating program in competitions.Russian team Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov hold the highest pair skating short program score of 81.21 points, which they earned at the 2019 World Figure Skating Championships.",289
Pair skating,Free skating,"According to the ISU, free skating for pairs ""consists of a well balanced program composed and skated to music of the pair's own choice for a specified period of time"".  The ISU also considers a well-done free skate one that contains both single skating moves performed either in parallel (called ""shadow skating"") or symmetrically (called ""mirror skating"").  It also should contain ""especially typical Pair Skating moves"" such as pair spins, lifts, partner assisted jumps, spirals and other similar moves, ""linked harmoniously by steps and other movements"".A well-balanced free skate for senior pairs must consist of the following: up to three pair lifts, not all from the same group, with the lifting arm or arms fully extended; exactly one twist lift, exactly one solo jump; exactly one jump sequence or combination; exactly one pair spin combination; exactly one death spiral of a different type than what the skaters performed during their short program; and exactly one choreographic sequence.  Its duration, like the other disciplines, is four minutes for senior teams, and three-and-one-half minutes for junior teams.Chinese team Wenjing Sui and Cong Han hold the highest pair free skating program score of 155.60 points, which they earned at the 2019 World Figure Skating Championships.",271
Pair skating,Competition requirements,"Pair skating required elements include pair lifts, twist lifts, throw jumps, jumps, spin combinations, death spirals, step sequences, and choreographic sequences.  The elements performed by pair teams must be ""linked together by connecting steps of a different nature"" and by other comparable movements and with a variety of holds and positions.  The team does not have to always execute the same movements and can separate from time to time, but they have to ""give an impression of unison and harmony of composition of program and of execution of the skating"".  They must limit movements executed on two feet, and must fully use the entire ice surface.  The ISU also states, about how programs are performed by pair skating teams, ""Harmonious steps and connecting movements, in time to the music, should be maintained throughout the program"".  The ISU published a judges' handbook describing what judges needed to look for during pair skating competitions in 1966.",195
Pair skating,Pair lifts,"There are five groups of pair skating lifts, categorized in order of increasing level of difficulty, and determined by the hold at the moment the woman passes the man's shoulder.
Group One: Armpit hold position
Group Two: Waist hold position
Group Three: Hand to hip or upper part of the leg (above the knee) position
Group Four: Hand to hand position (Press Lift type)
Group Five: Hand to hand position (Lasso Lift type)Judges look for the following when evaluating pair lifts: speed of entry and exit; control of the woman's free leg when she is exiting out of the lift, with the goal of keeping the leg high and sweeping; the position of the woman in the air; the man's footwork; quick and easy changes of position; and the maintenance of flow throughout the lift.  Judges begin counting how many revolutions pair teams execute from the moment when the woman leaves the ice until when the man's arm (or arms) begin to bend after he has made a full extension and the woman begins to descend.A complete pair skating lift must include full extension of the lifting arm or arms, if required for the type of lift being performed.  Small lifts, or ones in which the man does not raise his hands higher than his shoulders, or lifts that include movements in which the man holds the woman by the legs, are also allowed.  The man must complete at least one revolution.  The woman can perform both a simple take-off and a difficult take-off.  A difficult take-off can include, but is not limited to, the following: a somersault take-off; a one-hand take-off; an Ina Bauer; a spread-eagle; spirals as the entry curve executed by one or both partners; or a dance lift followed immediately by a pair lift take-off.  Difficult landings include, but are not limited to, the following: somersaults; one-hand landings; variations in holds; and spread-eagle positions of the man during dismounting.  Carry lifts are defined as ""the simple carrying of a partner without rotation"" are allowed; they do not count as overhead lifts, but are considered as transition elements.  A lift is judged illegal if it is accomplished with a wrong hold.The only times pair skating partners can give each other assistance in executing lifts are ""through hand-to-hand, hand-to-arm, hand-to-body and hand to upper part of the leg (above the knee) grips"".  They are allowed changes of hold, or going from one of the grips to another or from one hand to another in a one-hand hold, during lifts.  Teams earn fewer points if the woman's position and a change of hold is executed at the same time.  They earn more points if the execution of the woman's position and the change in hold are ""significantly different from lift to lift"".  Teams can increase the difficulty of lifts in any group by using a one-hand hold.There are three types of positions performed by the woman: upright, or when her upper body is vertical; the star, or when she faces sideways with her upper body parallel to the ice; and the platter, or when her position is flat and facing up or down with her upper body parallel to the ice.  The lifts ends when the man's arm or arms begins to bend after he completes a full extension and when the woman begins to descend.",722
Pair skating,Twist lifts,"Skate Canada calls twist lifts ""sometimes the most thrilling and exciting component in pair skating"".  They can also be most difficult movement to perform correctly.  Judges look for the following when evaluating twist lifts: speed at entry and exit; whether or not the woman performs a split position while on her way to the top of the twist lift; her height once she gets there; clean rotations; a clean catch by the male (accomplished by placing both hands at the woman's waist and without any part of her upper body touching him); and a one-foot exit executed by both partners.  A pairs team can make twist lifts more complicated when the woman executes a split position (each leg is at least 45° from her body axis and her legs are straight or almost straight) before rotating.  They also can earn more points when the man's arms are sideways and straight or almost straight after he releases the woman.  Difficult take-offs include turns, steps, movements, and small lifts executed preceding the take-off and with continuous flow. Pair teams lose points for not having enough rotations, one-half a rotation or more.The first quadruple twist lift performed in international competition was by Russian pair team Marina Cherkasova and Sergei Shakhrai at the European Championship in 1977.",267
Pair skating,Solo jumps,"Pair teams, both juniors and seniors, must perform one solo jump during their short programs; it can include a double flip or double Axel for juniors, or any kind of double or triple jump for seniors.  In the free skate, both juniors and seniors must perform only one solo jump and only one jump combination or sequence.  A jump sequence consists of two jumps, with no limitations on the number of revolutions per jump.  It starts with any type of jump, immediately followed by an Axel-type jump.  Skaters must, during a jump combination, make sure that they land on the same foot they took off on, and that they execute a full rotation on the ice between the jumps.  They can, however, execute an Euler between the two jumps.  When the Euler is performed separately, it is considered a non-listed jump.  Junior pairs, during their short programs, earn no points for the solo jump if they perform a different jump than what is required.  Both junior and senior pairs earn no points if, during their free skating programs, they repeat a jump with over two revolutions.All jumps are considered in the order in which they were performed.  If the partners do not execute the same number of revolutions during a solo jump or part of a jump sequence or combination (which can consist of two or three jumps), only the jump with the fewer revolutions will be counted in their score.  The double Axel and all triple and quadruple jumps, which have more than two revolutions, must be different from one another, although jump sequences and combinations can include the same two jumps.  Extra jumps that do not fulfill the requirements are not counted in the team's score.  Teams are allowed, however, to execute the same two jumps during a jump combination or sequence.  If they perform any or both jump or jumps incorrectly, only the incorrectly-done jump is not counted and it is not considered a jump sequence or combination.  Both partners can execute two solo jumps during their short programs, but the second jump is worth less points than the first.A jump attempt, in which one or both partners execute a clear preparation for a take-off but step to the entry edge or place their skate's toe pick into the ice and leave the ice with or without a turn, counts as one jump element. If the partners execute an unequal number of rotations during a solo jump or as part of a jump combination or sequence, the jump with the lesser number of revolutions will be counted. They receive no points if they perform different types of jumps.  A small hop or a jump with up to one-half revolution (considered ""decoration"") is not marked as a jump and called a ""transition"" instead.  Non-listed jumps do not count as jumps, either, but can also be called a transition and can be used as ""a special entrance to the jump"".  If the partners execute a spin and a jump back to back, or vice versa, they are considered separate elements and the team is awarded more points for executing a difficult take-off or entry.  They lose points if the partners fall or step out of a jump during a jump sequence or combination.",657
Pair skating,Throw jumps,"Throw jumps are ""partner assisted jumps in which the Lady is thrown into the air by the Man on the take-off and lands without assistance from her partner on a backward outside edge"".  Skate Canada says, ""the male partner assists the female into flight"".  Many pair skaters consider the throw jump ""a jump rather than a throw"".  The throw jump is also considered an assisted jump, performed by the woman.  The man supports the woman, initiates her rotations, and assists her with her height, timing, and direction.The types of throw jumps include: the throw Axel, the throw salchow, the throw toe loop, the throw loop, the throw flip, and the throw Lutz.  The speed of the team's entry into the throw jump and the number of rotations performed increases its difficulty, as well as the height and/or distance they create.  Pair teams must perform one throw jump during their short programs; senior teams can perform any double or triple throw jump, and junior teams must perform a double or triple loop.  If the throw jump does not satisfy the requirements as described by the ISU, including if it has the wrong number of revolutions, it receives no value.The first throw triple Axel jump performed in competition was by American pair team Rena Inoue and John Baldwin Jr. at the 2006 U.S. Championships.  They also performed it at the Four Continents Championships in 2006 and the 2006 Winter Olympics.  The throw triple Axel is a difficult throw to accomplish because the woman must perform three-and-one-half revolutions after being thrown by the man, a half-revolution more than other triple jumps, and because it requires a forward take-off.",355
Pair skating,Solo spin combinations,"The solo spin combination must be performed once during the short program of pair skating competitions, with at least two revolutions in two basic positions.  Both partners must include all three basic positions in order to earn the full points possible.  There must be a minimum of five revolutions made on each foot.  Spins can be commenced with jumps and must have at least two different basic positions, and both partners must include two revolutions in each position.  A solo spin combination must have all three basic positions (the camel spin, the sit spin, and upright positions) performed by both partners, at any time during the spin to receive the full value of points, and must have all three basic positions performed by both partners to receive full value for the element.  A spin with less than three revolutions is not counted as a spin; rather, it is considered a skating movement.  If a skater changes to a non-basic position, it is not considered a change of position.  The number of revolutions in non-basic positions, which may be considered difficult variations, are counted towards the team's total number of revolutions.  Only positions, whether basic or non-basic, must be performed by the partners at the same time.If a skater falls while entering into the spin, he or she can perform another spin or spinning movement immediately after the fall, to fill the time lost from the fall, but it is not counted as a solo spin combination.  A change of foot, in the form of a jump or step over, is allowed, and the change of position and change of foot can be performed separately or at the same time.  Pair teams require ""significant strength, skill and control"" to perform a change from a basic position to a different basic position without performing a nonbasic position first.  They also have to execute a continuous movement throughout the change, without jumps to execute it, and they must hold the basic position for two revolutions both before and after the change.  They lose points if they take a long time to reach the necessary basic position.Pair teams earn more points for performing difficult entrances and exits. An entrance is defined as ""the preparation immediately preceding a spin"", including a flying entrance by one or both partners; it can include the spin's beginning phase.  All entrances must have a ""significant impact"" on the spin's execution, balance, and control, and must be completed on the first spinning foot.  The intended spin position must be achieved within the team's first two revolutions, and can be non-basic in spin combinations only.  An exit is defined as ""the last phase of the spin""; it can include the phase immediately following the spin.  Like the entrance, an exit must have a ""significant impact"" on the spin's execution, balance, and control.  There are 11 categories of difficult solo spin variations.",584
Pair skating,Spin combinations,"Both junior and senior pair teams must perform one pair spin combination, which may begin with a fly spin, during their free skating programs.  Pair spin combinations must have at least eight revolutions, which must be counted from ""the entry of the spin until its exit"".  If spins are done with less than two revolutions, pairs receive zero points; if they have less than three revolutions, they are considered a skating movement, not a spin.  Pair teams cannot, except for a short step when changing directions, stop while performing a rotation.  Spins must have at least two different basic positions, with two revolutions in each position performed by both partners anywhere within the spin; full value for pair spin combinations are awarded only when both partners perform all three basic positions.  A spin executed in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions is considered one spin.  When a team simultaneously performs spins in both directions that immediately follow each other, they earn more points, but they must execute a minimum of three revolutions in each direction without any changes in position.Both partners must execute at least one change of position and one change of foot (although not necessarily done simultaneously); if not, the element will have no value.  Like the solo spin combination, the spin combination has three basic positions: the camel spin, the sit spin, and the upright spin.  Also like the solo spin combination, changes to a non-basic position is counted towards the team's total number of revolutions and are not considered a change of position.  A change of foot must have at least three revolutions, before and after the change, and can be any basic or non-basic position, in order for the element to be counted. The woman is allowed to be lifted from the ice during the spin, but her partner must stay on one foot, and the revolutions they execute while in the air counts towards the total number of revolutions. The ISU states that this does not increase the difficulty of a combination spin, but it does allow for creativity.Fluctuations of speed and variations of positions of the head, arms, or free leg are allowed.  Difficult variations of a combined pair spin must have at least two revolutions.  They receive more points if the spin contains three difficult variations, two of which can be non-basic positions, although each partner must have at least one difficult variation.  The same rules apply for difficult entrances into pair spin combinations as they do for solo spin combinations, except that they must be executed by both partners for the element to count towards their final score.  A difficult exit, in which the skaters exit the spin in a lift or spinning movement, is defined as ""an innovative move that makes the exit significantly more difficult""; Also like the solo spin combination, the exit must have ""significant impact on the balance, control and execution of the spin"". If one or both partners fall while entering a spin, they can execute a spin or a spinning movement to fill up time lost during the fall.",609
Pair skating,Death spirals,"The death spiral is ""a circular move in which the male lowers his partner to the ice while she is arched backwards gliding on one foot"".  There are four types of death spirals: the forward inside death spiral, the backward inside death spiral, the backward outside death spiral, and the forward outside death spiral.  According to Skate Canada, the forward inside death spiral is the easiest one to execute, and the forward outside death spiral is the most difficult.In the 2019–2020 season, both junior and senior pair teams must perform the backward inside death spiral, and the death spiral performed in the short program at the senior level must be different from the death spiral during the free skating program.  In 2020–2021, both juniors and seniors had to perform the forward inside death spiral. If a different death spiral other than what has been prescribed is executed, it receives no points.  One death spiral is required for juniors and seniors during their free skate.  The man is not allowed an opposite hand-hold as the team enters a death spiral during the short program, although it is allowed during the free skate.  The woman, however, can use an opposite hand-hold during both programs.  Both partners can execute a change of arm hold in both programs as well.",266
Pair skating,Step sequences,"Step sequences in pair skating should be performed ""together or close together"". Step sequences must be a part of the short program, but they are not required in the free skating program. There is no required pattern, but pair teams must fully use the ice surface. The step sequence must be ""visible and identifiable"", in any shape they like (oval, circle, straight line, or serpentine). The team must skate three meters or less near each other while executing the crossing feature of the sequence. They must not separate, with no breaks, for at least half of the sequence.  Changes of holds, which can include ""a brief moment"" when the partners do not touch, are permitted during the step sequence.The workload between the partners must be even to help them earn more points. More points are rewarded to teams when they change places or holds, or when they perform difficult skating moves together. Both partners must execute the combinations of difficult turns at the same time and with a clear rhythm and continuous flow. Partners can perform rockers, counters, brackets, loops, and twizzles during combinations of difficult turns. Three turns, changes of edges, jumps and/or hops, and changes of feet are not allowed, and ""at least one turn in the combination must be of a different type than the others"". Two combinations of difficult turns are the same if they consist of the same turns performed in the same order, on the same foot and on the same edges.",298
Pair skating,Choreographic sequences,"Pair teams must perform one choreographic sequence during their free skating programs.  According to the ISU, a choreographic sequence ""consists of any kind of movements like steps, turns, spirals, arabesques, spread eagles, Ina Bauers, hydroblading, any jumps with maximum of 2 revolutions, spins, small lifts, etc.""  It begins at the first skating movement and ends when the team begins to prepare to execute the next element, unless the sequence is the last element performed during the program. Judges do not evaluate individual elements in a choreographic segment; rather, they note that it was accomplished.  There are no restrictions limiting the sequence of the movements, but the sequence must be ""clearly visible"".  Pair skaters, in order to earn the most points possible, must include the following in their choreographic sequences: they must have originality and creativity; the sequence must match the music and reflect the program's concept and character; and they must demonstrate effortlessness of the element as a sequence.  They must also do the following: ""have good ice coverage"" or perform an interesting pattern; demonstrate good unison between the partners; and demonstrate ""excellent commitment"" and control of the whole body.",257
Pair skating,Rules and regulations,"Skaters must only execute the prescribed elements; if they do not, the extra or unprescribed elements will not be counted in their score. Only the first attempt of an element will be included.  Violations in pair skating include falls, time, music, and clothing.",60
Pair skating,Falls,"According to the ISU, a fall is defined as the ""loss of control by a Skater with the result that the majority of his/her own body weight is on the ice supported by any other part of the body other than the blades; e.g. hand(s), knee(s), back, buttock(s) or any part of the arm"".For pair skaters, one point is deducted for every fall by one partner, and two points are deducted for every fall by both partners.  According to former American figure skater Katrina Hacker, falls occur for the following reasons: the skater makes an error during his or her takeoff; his or her jump is under-rotated, or not fully rotated while the skater is in the air; the skater executes a tilted jump and is unable to land upright on his or her feet; and the skater makes an error during the first jump of a combination jump, resulting in not having enough smoothness, speed, and flow to complete the second jump.  If there is an interruption while performing their program, skaters can lose one point if it lasts more than 10 seconds but not over 20 seconds.  They can lose two points if the interruption lasts 20 seconds but not over 30 seconds, and three points if it lasts 30 seconds but not more than 40 seconds.  They can lose five points if they can resume their program three minutes after the interruption begins.  ISU rules leave stopping a program for medical reasons up to the discretion of the competition referee, who decides, after consulting with the skaters' team physician or the doctor provided by the competition's organizer, to end a program, but it must be done within three minutes after the fall or interruption; if not, the skater or team must withdraw. They can also lose five points if the interruption is caused by an ""adverse condition"" up to three minutes before the start of their program.",396
Pair skating,Time,"As for all skating disciplines, judges penalize pair skaters one point up to every five seconds for ending their programs too early or too late.  If they start their programs between one and 30 seconds late, they can lose one point.  Restrictions for finishing the short program and the free skating program are similar to the requirements of the other disciplines in figure skating.  They can complete these programs within plus or minus 10 seconds of the required times; if they cannot, judges can deduct points if they finish up to five seconds too early or too late.  If they begin skating any element after their required time (plus the required 10 seconds they have to begin), they earn no points for those elements.  The pair team receive no points if the duration of their program is completed less than 30 seconds or more seconds early.",169
Pair skating,Music,"The ISU defines the interpretation of the music in all figure skating disciplines as ""the personal, creative, and genuine translation of the rhythm, character and content of music to movement on ice"".  Judges take the following things into account when scoring the short program and the free skating program: the steps and movement in time to the music; the expression of the character of the music; and the use of finesse.The use of vocals was expanded to pair skating, as well as to single skating, starting in 2014; the first Olympics affected by this change was in 2018 in PyeongChang, South Korea.  The ISU's decision, done to increase the sport's audience, to encourage more participation, and to give skaters and choreographers more choice in constructing their programs, had divided support among skaters, coaches, and choreographers.If the quality or tempo of the music the team uses in their program is deficient, or if there is a stop or interruption in their music, no matter the reason, they must stop skating when they become aware of the problem or when signaled to stop by a skating official, whichever occurs first. If any problems with the music happens within 20 seconds after they have begun their program, the team can choose to either restart their program or to continue from the point where they have stopped performing. If they decide to continue from the point where they stopped, they are continued to be judged at that point onward, as well as their performance up to that point. If they decide to restart their program, they are judged from the beginning of their restart and what they had done previously must be disregarded. If the music interruption occurs more than 20 seconds after they have begun their program, or if it occurred during an element or at the entrance of an element, they must resume their program from the point of the interruption. If the element was identified before the interruption, the element must be deleted from the list of performed elements, and the team is allowed to repeat the element when they resume their program. No deductions are counted for interruptions due to music deficiencies.",424
Pair skating,Clothing,"As for the other disciplines of figure skating, the clothing worn by pair skaters at ISU Championships, the Olympics, and international competitions must be ""modest, dignified and appropriate for athletic competition—not garish or theatrical in design"".  Props and accessories are not allowed.  Clothing can reflect the character of the skaters' chosen music and must not ""give the effect of excessive nudity inappropriate for the discipline"".  All men must wear trousers, a rule that has been in effect since the 1994–1995 season.  Since 2003, women skaters have been able to wear skirts, trousers, tights, and unitards.  Decorations on costumes must be ""non-detachable""; judges can deduct one point per program if part of the competitors' costumes or decorations fall on the ice.  If there is a costume or prop violation, the judges can deduct one point per program.
If competitors do not adhere to these guidelines, the judges can deduct points from their total score, if most of the panel, including the referee, thinks a skater's outfit is inappropriate.  However, costume deductions are rare.  Juliet Newcomer from U.S. Figure Skating stated that by the time skaters get to a national or world championship, they have received enough feedback about their costumes and are no longer willing to take any more risks of losing points.  Former competitive skater and designer Braden Overett told the New York Post that there is ""an informal review process before major competitions such as the Olympics, during which judges communicate their preferences"".Also according to the New York Post, one of the goals of skaters and designers is to ensure that a costume's design, which can ""make or break a performance"", does not affect the skaters' scores.  According to former competitive skater and fashion writer Shalayne Pulia, figure skating costume designers are part of a skater's ""support team"".  Designers collaborate with skaters and their coaches to help them design costumes that fit the themes and requirements of their programs for months before the start of each season.  There have been calls to require figure skaters to wear uniforms like other competitive sports, in order to make the sport less expensive and more inclusive, and to emphasize its athletic side.

Pair skating,Injuries,"Australian single skater and coach Belinda Noonan stated, ""Pairs skating is literally physically more dangerous than the other three disciplines"".  American pair skater Nathan Bartholomay agreed, comparing the danger in pair skating to playing in the National Football League.  Sportswriter Sandra Loosemore, in her discussion of the accidents in all figure skating disciplines, stated that the ""very nature"" of pair skating ""adds an extra dimension of danger and risk of injury"" because of the high speed and close proximity pair teams skate to each other, and the lifts and other elements in pair skating.  Both members of a pair skating team can receive broken noses and other injuries from performing twist lifts incorrectly, and although male partners are taught to protect their partners in case of a fall from an overhead lift, concussions and serious head injuries are common.  The ISU has banned and restricted dangerous tricks and moves from pair skating, but both skating audiences and skaters have demanded them.  Skaters have resisted using protective gear, even during practice, because it interferes with developing self-confidence and is seen as incompatible with ""the aesthetic aspects of the sport"".A study conducted during a U.S. national competition including 60 pair skaters recorded an average of 1.83 injuries per athlete, the most of any figure skating discipline.  Single skaters and ice dancers have more lower body injuries, but pair skaters suffer more upper body injuries, ""with 50% occurring to the head (e.g., facial lacerations, concussions)"".  According to figure skating researchers Jason Vescovi and Jaci VanHeest, these injuries are ""an obvious consequence of the throws and side-by-side jumps performed in this discipline"".  A study conducted in 1989 found that ice dancers and pair skaters, during a nine-month period of time, can experience serious injuries (defined as the athletes missing seven or more consecutive days of training after their injuries), and that women pair skaters have more injuries than men, which Vescovi and VanHeest attributed to the demands of pair skating.",431

Youth Olympic Games,Summary,"The Youth Olympic Games (YOG) is an international multi-sport event for athletes between 15 and 18 years old, organized by the International Olympic Committee. The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format, though in reverse order with Olympic Winter Games held in leap years instead of Summer Olympic Games. The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck, Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012.The idea of such an event was introduced by Johann Rosenzopf from Austria in 1998. On 6 July 2007, International Olympic Committee (IOC) members at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City approved the creation of a youth version of the Olympic Games, with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city, whereas the travelling costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC. These Games will also feature cultural exchange programs and opportunities for participants to meet Olympic athletes.
Several other Olympic events for youth, like the European Youth Olympic Festival held every other year with summer and winter versions, and the Australian Youth Olympic Festival, have proven successful.  The Youth Games are modelled after these sporting events. The YOG are also a successor to the discontinued World Youth Games.
The Summer Youth Olympic Games of Singapore in 2010 and Nanjing in 2014 each played host to 3600 athletes and lasted 13 days, whereas the Winter YOG of Innsbruck in 2012 had 1059 athletes and Lillehammer in 2016 had 1100 athletes and lasted 10 days. Even though this exceeded initial estimates, the YOG are still both smaller in size as well as shorter than their senior equivalents. The most recent Summer YOG was the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games of Buenos Aires. The most recent Winter YOG was the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games of Lausanne. The next Summer YOG to take place will be the 2026 Summer Youth Olympics of Dakar, Senegal while the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics will take place in Gangwon, South Korea.",430
Youth Olympic Games,History,"The concept of the Youth Olympic Games came from Austrian industrial manager Johann Rosenzopf in 1998. This was in response to growing global concerns about childhood obesity and the dropping participation of youth in sport activities, especially amongst youth in developed nations. It was further recognized that a youth version of the Olympic Games would help foster participations in the Olympic Games. Despite these reasons for having an Olympic event for young people, the IOC's response of holding a purely sporting event was negative. IOC delegates wanted the event to be as much about cultural education and exchange as it was about sports, which is why the Culture and Education Program (CEP) was developed as a component of each celebration of the Games. Jacques Rogge, IOC President, formally announced plans for the Youth Olympic Games at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City on 6 July 2007. There are several goals for the YOG, and four of them include bringing together the world's best young athletes, offering an introduction into Olympism, innovating in educating and debating Olympic values. The city of Singapore was announced as the host of the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics on 21 February 2008. On 12 December 2008 the IOC announced that Innsbruck, host of the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics, would be the host of the inaugural Winter Youth Olympics in 2012.",265
Youth Olympic Games,Requirements of host cities,"The scale of the Youth Olympic Games is smaller than that of the Olympics, which is intentional and allows for smaller cities to host an Olympic event.  Potential host cities are required to keep all events within the same city and no new sports venues should be built. Exceptions to this building moratorium include a media centre, amphitheatre facilities for classes and workshops, and a village for coaches and athletes. This village is to be the heart of the Games for the athletes, and the hub of activity. No new or unique transportation systems are required as all athletes and coaches will be transported by shuttles. According to bid procedures, the track and field stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies must hold 10,000 people, and a city must have a 2,500-seat aquatics facility (for Summer editions).",168
Youth Olympic Games,Financing,"The original estimated costs for running the Games were US$30 million for the Summer and $15 million to $20 million for Winter Games (these costs did not include infrastructure improvements for venue construction). The IOC has stipulated that costs for infrastructure and venues is to be paid by the host city. The IOC will pay travel costs to the host city and room and board for the athletes and judges, estimated at $11 million. The funding will come from IOC funds and not revenues.  The budgets for the final two bids for the inaugural Summer Games as submitted by the IOC came in at $90 million, much higher than the estimated costs. The cost of the first games in Singapore escalated to an estimated S$387 million ($284 million). Sponsors have been slow to sign on for the YOG, due to the fact that it is a new initiative and corporations are not sure what level of exposure they will get. The budget for the inaugural Winter Games to be held in Innsbruck has been estimated at $22.5 million, which does not include infrastructure improvements and venue construction.",222
Youth Olympic Games,Participation,"Over 200 countries and 3,600 athletes participated in the inaugural 2010 Youth Summer Olympics. Participants are placed in the following age groups: 15-16 years, 16–17 years, and 17–18 years. The athlete's age is determined by how old he or she is by 31 December of the year they are participating in the YOG. Qualification to participate in the Youth Olympics is determined by the IOC in conjunction with the International Sport Federations (ISF) for the various sports on the program. To ensure that all nations are represented at the YOG the IOC instituted the concept of Universality Places.  A certain number of spots in each event are to be left open for athletes from under-represented nations regardless of qualifying marks.  This is to ensure that every nation will be able to send at least four athletes to each Youth Olympic Games. For team tournaments one team per continent will be allowed to compete along with a sixth team either representing the host nation or as proposed by the IF with IOC approval.  There is a cap of two teams (one boys' and one girls') per nation. Finally, no nation may enter more than 70 athletes in individual sports.",240
Youth Olympic Games,Summer,"There have been 37 sports from the 2010 to 2026 Olympic programs at one point to another. Twenty-seven sports were introduced in the 2010 Games. Two new sports were introduced in 2014 Games, which were beach volleyball (replacing volleyball) and field hockey. In the 2018 Games, six sports were introduced: beach handball (replacing handball), breakdancing, futsal (replacing football), karate, roller speed skating and sport climbing. 28 core sports are expected to feature in the 2026 Games, being confirmed in 2019. In July 2020, it was agreed by both host nation Senegal and the International Olympic Committee that the 2022 Summer Youth Olympics would not be held and would instead be pushed back to 2026.",151
Youth Olympic Games,Winter,"There have been 46 disciplines across 16 sports in the Winter Youth Olympics between the 2012 Games to the 2020 Games. In the 2012 Games at Innsbruck and the 2016 Games at Lillehammer, there were only 15 sports. In the next Games, the 2020 Games at Lausanne,
a new sport, ski mountaineering, was added.",75
Youth Olympic Games,Culture and education,"Education and culture are also key components for the Youth edition. Not only does the education/culture aspect apply to athletes and participants, but also youth around the world and inhabitants of the host city and surrounding regions. To this end, a Culture and Education Program (CEP) will be featured at each Games. The first CEP at the 2010 Singapore Games featured events that fostered cooperation amongst athletes of different nations.  It had classes on topics ranging from health and fitness to the environment and career planning.  Local students from Singapore made booths at the World Culture Village that represented each of the 205 participating National Olympic Committee. The Chat with Champions sessions were the most popular portion of the program. Participants were invited to hear inspirational talks given by former and current Olympic athletes.Also part of the CEP is the Young Ambassadors Programme, Young Reporters Programme and Athlete Role Models. Under the Young Ambassadors Programme, a group of youths aged 18 to 25 years old are nominated by the NOCs to help promote the YOG in their regions and communities, and encourage the athletes to participate in the CEP programmes.
The Young Reporters Programme provides journalism students or those who have recently started their journalism careers a cross-platform journalist-training programme and on-the-job experience during the YOG. Young Reporters, between the ages of 18 and 24, are selected by the Continental Associations of National Olympic Committees and will represent each of the five continents.
Acting as mentors to help support and advise young Olympians are the Athlete Role Models, who are typically active or recently retired Olympians nominated by the IFs, such as Japanese wrestler Kaori Icho, Italian Simone Farina and Namibian Frank Fredericks.Emphasis on exchange goes beyond the CEP.  Another unique feature of the Youth Olympic Games is mixed-gender and mixed-national teams.  Triathlon relays, fencing, table tennis, archery and mixed swimming relays are a few of the sports in which athletes from different nations and mixed genders can compete together. YOG organizers are also using social media such as Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter as key platforms for engaging young athletes before, during, and after each celebration of the Games. Multi-lingual, multi-cultural, and multi-age requirements are the targets of the program, which stress the themes of ""Learning to know, learning to be, learning to do, and learning to live together"".",500
Youth Olympic Games,List of Youth Olympic Games,"In early November 2007, Athens, Bangkok, Singapore, Moscow, and Turin were selected by the IOC as the five candidate cities to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. In January 2008, the candidates were further pared down to just Moscow and Singapore. Finally, on 21 February 2008, Singapore was declared host of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games 2010 via live telecast from Lausanne, Switzerland, winning by a tally of 53 votes to 44 for Moscow.On 2 September 2008 IOC announced that the executive board had shortlisted four cities among the candidates to host the first Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012. The four candidate cities were Harbin, Innsbruck, Kuopio, and Lillehammer. IOC president Jacques Rogge appointed Pernilla Wiberg to chair the commission which analysed the projects. As with the Summer Games, the list was then shortened to two finalists, Innsbruck and Kuopio, in November 2008. On 12 December 2008, it was announced that Innsbruck beat Kuopio to host the games. Nanjing, China was selected by the IOC over Poznan, Poland to be the host-city of the 2014 Youth Olympics. The election was held on 10 February 2010, two days before the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Lillehammer, Norway hosted the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.",281

Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Qualification,Qualifying standards,"A National Olympic Committee (NOC) may enter up to 3 qualified athletes in each individual event if all athletes meet the entry standard during the qualifying period. An NOC may also enter a maximum of 1 qualified relay team per event. Under the universality rule, NOCs may enter one male athlete and one female athlete, regardless of time, if they have no athletes of that gender meeting the entry standard. This makes it possible for every NOC to have a minimum of two representatives in the sports. These universality spots cannot be used in the combined events, the 10,000 metres, or the 3,000 metre steeplechase.The qualifying system for Tokyo 2020 saw fundamental changes from the previous Olympics. While the qualification from Rio 2016 and other previous editions relied on qualifying standards, Tokyo 2020 is primarily based on world ranking. World Athletics, the global sport governing body formerly known as IAAF until a name change in 2019, continues to set qualifying times, but these are ""set for the sole purpose of qualifying athletes with exceptional performances unable to qualify through the World Athletics Rankings pathway."" The number of entrants per event is capped, with different caps for different events varying from 24 athletes for the combined events to 80 (finally 110) athletes for the marathons.The World Athletics Rankings are based on the average of the best five results for the athlete over the qualifying period. The results are weighted by the importance of the meet.The qualifying standards may be obtained in various meets during the given period approved by the World Athletics. The qualifying period for the marathon and the 50 km race walk occurs from 1 January 2019 to 5 April 2020 and from 1 December 2020 to 31 May 2021 and the qualifying for the 10,000 m, 20 km race walk and combined events occurs from 1 January 2019 to 5 April 2020 and from 1 December 2020 to 29 June 2021, with the rest of the track and field events happening from 1 May 2019 to 5 April 2020 and from 1 December 2020 to 29 June 2021. The most recent Area Championships may be counted in the ranking, even if not during the qualifying period. On 6 April 2020, the World Athletics announced that the qualification period for the Games was suspended until 30 November 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In July 2020, World Athletics announced that the suspension period would be lifted for the road events (marathons and race walks) on 1 September 2020.For the relays, a maximum of sixteen qualified NOCs shall be entitled to each event. The top eight teams in each event at the 2019 World Championships in Athletics (held in Doha from 28 September to 6 October 2019) guarantee a spot on their respective NOCs for the Olympics. The remaining half in each event are selected at the 2021 World Athletics Relays and according to World Athletics Top List as of 29 June 2021.NOCs with more than three qualified athletes in an individual event may select, using their own rules, athletes from among those qualified. For example, the United States selects athletes based on the result of the 2020 United States Olympic Trials meet, but has a policy of entering every athlete qualified. Sweden only enters athletes good enough to reach at least the eighth position, based on an assessment by the Swedish NOC.
A tracking system of qualification is published by World Athletics: Road to 2020 Olympic Games. This Road to Tokyo tool shows which athletes – subject to being officially selected by their NOC – have qualified to compete. This tool identifies the first 3 qualifiers per country (in bold) but any athlete who has qualified, by Standard or Ranking, can be selected within the limit of 3 per nation. As this is a qualification monitoring tool, not an entry monitoring tool, it won't highlight which athletes have been officially selected by their NOC, but team announcements of many of the leading nations will be later published by World Athletics.
Some 1900 athletes, from more than 190 countries, will compete at the Olympic Games when the athletics will begin on 30 July.
The qualification period for all stadium events finished on 29 June and the qualification system has now been finalised, showing that about 70% of the athletes in individual events have qualified by entry standard and 30% by world ranking position, while 101 universality places have been awarded.
As already reported when the qualification closed for the longer road events, the men's and women's marathon exceeded their event quotas. This is also the case in the men's and women's 10,000m and the women's triple jump. No ranking place was necessary to complete the field in the men's shot put. But in those cases, regardless of the events’ quotas, any athlete with a qualification standard will still be eligible for selection to compete in Tokyo.
Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics, said: “Olympic qualification processes are always a bit fraught because there's so much on the line for the athletes, but it's exciting to see the Olympic fields take shape as the Tokyo Games approach, and it's pleasing to see that the extended qualifying process we put in place when the Games were postponed last year ultimately allowed more athletes to reach the entry standards”. “With Tokyo 2020 less than a month away, and this last milestone complete, anticipation is growing rapidly for what shapes as an extraordinary competition ahead, based on some of the performances we have seen this year. I'm delighted to see that more than 190 countries will be represented in athletics in Tokyo, reflecting the unmatched universality of our sport, and I look forward to seeing all those athletes competing at the Games from 30 July.”Athletes must have been born before 1 January 2006 (that, be at least 16 years old at the end of 2021) to compete. Youth athletes (born in 2004 or 2005, age 16 or 17 at the end of 2021) cannot compete in the throwing events, combined events, marathons, race walks, or 10,000 metre events. Junior athletes (born in 2002 or 2003, age 18 or 19 at the end of 2021) may compete in any event but cannot compete in the marathons or the 50 kilometre race walk.The World Athletics Qualifying Standards are as follows:",1260

Miraitowa and Someity,Summary,"Miraitowa (Japanese: ミライトワ) is the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity (Japanese: ソメイティ) is the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics. The events were held in Tokyo, Japan, in 2021. The checkered design on both mascots was inspired by the ichimatsu moyo pattern of the Tokyo 2020 official logo, while Someity's pink design was inspired by cherry blossoms. Both fictional characters have various superpowers, such as teleportation.
Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competitive process that took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, which then selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs from the batch to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision. The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for ""future"" (未来, mirai) and ""eternity"" (永久, towa), and Someity is named after someiyoshino (ソメイヨシノ), a type of cherry blossom. Someity's name also echoes the English phrase ""so mighty"". The mascots helped financing the Tokyo Games through merchandising and licensing deals.",303
Miraitowa and Someity,Selection and naming process,"In late 2017 and early 2018, the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee held a competition to determine the design of the 2020 mascots. A total of 2,042 design submissions were accepted between 1 August and 14 August 2017. The entries were then subjected to a series of format and design examinations led by media specialists and the Organising Committee's Mascot Selection Panel to determine whether they ""would appeal to elementary school-aged children"" and whether they ""amply reflected the spirit of the Tokyo 2020 Games Vision"".By mid-October 2017, this process reduced the pool to a shortlist of three sets of mascot candidates, which were unveiled on 7 December 2017. Each set included two mascots: one for the Olympic Games and the other for the Paralympic Games. Between 11 December 2017 and 22 February 2018, an election was conducted across 16,769 Japanese elementary schools to choose the winning entry, with each participating elementary school class allocated one vote. In total, 205,755 elementary school classes participated in the election, which was about 75% of elementary schools in Japan.
The chosen mascots were announced without names on 28 February 2018. The winning entry was candidate pair A, created by Ryo Taniguchi. The Mascot Selection Panel held a vote on a shortlist of proposed names on 28 May 2018, and names with the most votes were subjected to a trademark verification process before they became official. The names of the mascots, Miraitowa and Someity, were announced when the mascots made their formal debut at a press event on 22 July 2018.",324
Miraitowa and Someity,Characteristics,"Miraitowa, the Olympic mascot, is a figure with blue-checkered patterns inspired by the Games' official logo, which uses a similar checkered pattern called ichimatsu moyo that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867. It is intended to embody ""both old tradition and new innovation"". The character has a ""strong sense of justice"" and is described as ""very athletic"". It has the ability to teleport anywhere instantly. Miraitowa's name is a combination of the Japanese words ""future"" (未来, mirai) and ""eternity"" (永久, towa). According to the Tokyo 2020 organizers, the name ""was chosen to promote a future full of eternal hope in the hearts of people all over the world"".Someity, the Paralympic mascot, is a figure with pink-checkered patterns inspired by cherry blossoms and also the Games' official logo. The character is described as ""usually calm"" but can become ""very powerful when needed"". The character can fly using its checkered cape and send telepathic messages using its cherry blossom-shaped antennae. It can also ""talk to stones and the wind"" and move objects by looking at them. Someity is named after someiyoshino, a type of cherry blossom, and it is also intended to refer to the English phrase ""so mighty"".Although the two mascots have conflicting personalities, they nonetheless have a strong friendship and respect for each other. According to their fictional backgrounds, Miraitowa and Someity ""live in the digital world"", and through the Internet, they can transport themselves between the digital world and the real world. According to Sadashige Aoki, an advertising theory professor at Hosei University, the mascots follow a Japanese tradition of ""creating personalized characters out of nature — mountains, rivers, animals and plants"", as well as a ""tradition of animism, a belief that every natural thing has a soul"".",420
Miraitowa and Someity,Artist,"The mascots were designed by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, who lives in the Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan. Taniguchi was persuaded by his father, who is also an illustrator, to study art at Cabrillo College in California. He has illustrated English-language textbooks for Japanese children.Taniguchi discovered the Tokyo 2020 mascot competition on Facebook in February 2017 and came up with the idea of creating a character whose head resembled a samurai war helmet with the ichimatsu moyo pattern of the official Tokyo 2020 logo. After making a rough sketch, Taniguchi reworked the design after the competition's official application requirements were announced in May 2017. In designing the mascots, Taniguchi focused on the mascots' eyes to make his proposal stand out.Taniguchi was uninvolved in the naming of the mascots, though he did attend a screening at which various naming proposals were introduced. As part of the agreement to use the mascots, Taniguchi transferred intellectual property rights to the mascots to the Olympic and Paralympic committees, and as a result, he will not receive any royalty payments from mascot-related licensing.",242
Miraitowa and Someity,Merchandising,"The mascots are expected to generate revenue to help finance the Tokyo Games. An Olympic official expected the mascots to generate $130 million (¥14.4 billion) in revenue from licensing and merchandising. The organizers of Tokyo 2020 had been criticized for its budget management. According to Reuters, a 2016 study found that overall expenses for the Olympics could be ""four times the initial estimate made in the bid process"". Tokyo 2020 must transfer intellectual property rights to the mascots to the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee after the Games are concluded, which would prevent Tokyo from licensing and developing the mascots after the Games are over.From late July to early September 2018, a ""Mascot House"" was located on the first floor of the Tokyo Midtown Hibiya building, where visitors could take photos with the mascots and purchase licensed merchandise featuring the mascots. On 11 July 2019, the Tokyo 2020 organizers unveiled new merchandise, some of it featuring the mascots. As of July 2019, merchandise can be purchased either online or through authorized vendors throughout Japan.Plush dolls of Miraitowa and Someity were attached to the bouquets given to Olympic and Paralympic medalists at Tokyo 2020, with their ""armor"" in the color of the athlete's medal, as part of their design by the Nippon Flower Council.",278
Miraitowa and Someity,Robotics,"On 22 July 2019, the organizers of the 2020 Summer Olympics announced that robotic automatons of Miraitowa and Someity, among other robots, were expected to be included during the Games. According to the Los Angeles Times, the robots are ""programmed to show facial expressions as they wave at and shake hands with athletes and fans"". The Tokyo 2020 organizing committee plans to use the mascots primarily to promote the Games and greet visitors and athletes, attempting to increase engagement with children. The robots were also featured as part of a ""1 Year to Go"" press event on 22 July 2019 at an Olympic venue in Tokyo. The robots were included as part of another press event on 18 November 2019 at a Japanese elementary school. The robots' eyes can change to display hearts, along with other emotions, and their multiple joints and arms can be remotely controlled. Cameras allow the robots to recognize and respond to facial expressions. The robots were developed in collaboration with Toyota.",196
Miraitowa and Someity,Animation,"On 22 July 2019, the official Japanese Twitter account of Tokyo 2020 posted an animated short depicting Miraitowa participating in all the sports to be contested at the Games. On 25 August 2019, the same Twitter account posted a similar animated video featuring Someity participating in the Paralympic Games.",61
Miraitowa and Someity,Reception,"The public reaction to the mascot selection was ""generally positive"", according to an article published on Forbes' website in March 2018 by contributor Jake Adelstein. Adelstein described the mascots as ""cute"", though he commented that ""there was some criticism of the futuristic blue and pink characters falling clearly into traditional gender roles"". Adelstein speculated that the mascots would support the Olympics in Tokyo financially. Multiple observers compared the design of the mascots to that of the Pokémon and Digimon franchises. An article by Agence France-Presse described the social media reaction to the mascot selection on as ""mixed"". Some users commented that the mascots were ""very Japanese and very cute"", while others commented that the mascots should have been ""more round"" or ""more huggable"". Other commentators said that the selected design ""appealed more to children whereas adults preferred the softer and more traditional options"".Dan McQuade wrote in an article in sports news website Deadspin that it will be difficult for Miraitowa and Someity to match the popularity of Soohorang and Bandabi, the mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics, citing statements from the BBC, which wrote that the 2020 mascots ""have a tough act to follow"", and The Japan Times, which wrote in a headline that the success of Soohorang and Bandabi ""leaves Japan in a bind"". James Dator, in a blog entry published on the sports news website SB Nation, wrote that there is ""nothing functionally wrong"" with the mascot design, but felt that Sanae Akimoto's pair C was a superior candidate and should have been chosen instead. Dator also argued that children should not have been the ones to make the final decision. On the other hand, Naoki Ogi, a Japanese pedagogy expert, emphasized the importance of the role of children in selecting the mascots, as opposed to adults. Japanese author Rurika Suzuki said that the mascots have a ""a very Japanese anime-like quality"", describing them as ""brilliant and sporty and perfect for the Olympics"".In an article published in The New York Times on 27 July 2021, Mike Ives and Hikari Hida commented that, despite the typical importance of mascots in Japanese advertising, the mascots have had a ""subdued"" presence at the Tokyo Olympics, commenting that ""the Japanese public is not swooning over them either, according to fans and experts who study the country’s mascot industry"". Ives and Hida described a common complaint being that the names of the mascots, Miraitowa and Someity, are difficult to remember. The article quoted a mother named Yuki Fuka, who commented, ""Within the whirlwind of all the Olympic controversy, I think the mascots were forgotten somewhere along the way [...] The Games have just started and their existence is already an afterthought."" According to Jillian Rae Suter, a professor of informatics at Shizuoka University, ""They’re not hated, design-wise. They seem to be functional. They seem to be doing a good job [...] But there doesn’t seem to be a lot of passion for them."" Because Miraitowa and Someity did not appear during the 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, a social media user named Suekichiii tweeted a popular picture depicting them watching the ceremony from home.",695

In July 2020, the COV formed a working group to re-organize the Americas boxing qualifying event, which had been due to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, earlier that year but was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic event restrictions.In December 2020, the COV held X Session, which ""aims to reinforce Olympic values.""

Venezuela at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Medalists,"In terms of medals, the 2020 Games was Venezuela's best performance in its participation history, receiving one gold and three silver medals, as well as six diplomas. In Venezuela, controversy arose over statements made by the medalists in supervised calls to president Nicolás Maduro. Political scientists have noted that the Venezuelan government used Olympic success as a form of propaganda.

Venezuela's first medal of the Games was won by weightlifter Julio Mayora on 28 July, taking the silver medal in the men's 73 kg category and dedicating it to late president Hugo Chávez, who had been born on 28 July. Noticiero Digital reported that in the video featuring the dedication to Chávez, Venezuelan Youth and Sport Minister Mervin Maldonado can be heard in the background instructing Mayora to say it. Mayora's silver is Venezuela's second weightlifting medal after Israel Rubio's bronze at Athens 2004. The Caracas Chronicles reported that Mayora, who still lives in Venezuela though trains in the Dominican Republic, told friends that the best part about winning the medal is that he can now claim a better house for his mother from the government.Mayora was attacked on social media in Venezuela for the dedication. The next day, president Nicolás Maduro took to national television to defend Mayora as a patriot and say that the nation's sporting ""generation of gold"" started with Chávez. El Pitazo interviewed Venezuelan Olympic cyclist Daniel Dhers about the controversy, with Dhers saying that regardless of politics, everyone is at the Games for Venezuela. Prior to the controversy, Juan Guaidó had congratulated Mayora on the win. Caracas Chronicles condemned how quickly people turned from praising a medalist to hating him because of the video, while El País noted that outside of the Twitter vitriol Mayora's dedication was ""generally tolerated and understood"".On 31 July, Keydomar Vallenilla took another weightlifting silver medal, in the men's 96 kg category, and on 1 August, Daniel Dhers won the men's BMX freestyle silver medal, in its Olympic debut. Later in the day, Yulimar Rojas won the gold medal in women's triple jump. She is Venezuela's first female Olympic gold medalist, and also Venezuela's first athletics gold and third gold medal overall. It is Venezuela's third medal in the triple jump, following Rojas' silver at Rio 2016 and Asnoldo Devonish's bronze at Helsinki 1952, which was also Venezuela's first-ever Olympic medal.Each of the medalists was obliged to speak with and thank Maduro under supervision of Venezuelan officials shortly after their wins, with the calls (which were filmed) shared on official channels in Venezuela. In Rojas' call, Maduro called her ""the queen of Tokyo"". He later shared a message on Twitter lauding the athlete: ""warrior, you shine with your own light, you are a faithful reflection of the fighting spirit and greatness of the Venezuelan people."" Guaidó also celebrated that she had literally gone further than anyone before. El Nacional noted that the athletes have faced criticism at home for praising Maduro in the calls. In an opinion column, it acknowledged the statements were ""guided if not forced"" and that the athletes would be concerned for family in Venezuela, but said that Krystsina Tsimanouskaya had more dignity in criticizing her nation.",691

Venezuela at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Men's flyweight,"Yoel Finol, brother-in-law to the iconic late disgraced Venezuelan boxer Edwin Valero, was awarded the silver medal at Rio 2016 after originally winning the bronze when silver medalist Mikhail Aloyan was disqualified for doping. In the run-up to the Tokyo Games, in early 2021, Finol shared a statement to say that he forgave Valero for killing his sister, and wanted to move on ""if only for his own peace of mind."" He also expressed more optimism than he said he felt at the 2016 Games, as he had only just joined the national team then and in 2021 had more practice and technique.He was uncertain if he would qualify for the 2020 Olympics, and his Olympiad had been disrupted. Due to the crisis in Venezuela, the boxing team were not given the resources to travel to major competitions, which negatively affected the rankings of its boxers. Finol took up professional boxing in 2019 to make money and continue competing. As the COVID-19 pandemic also saw the Americas qualifying boxing competition canceled, the Venezuelans could not prove themselves in the ring and had to rely on their rankings.
Finol represented Venezuela in the men's flyweight on 26 July, going out in the round of 32 after losing on points by unanimous decision to eventual bronze medal winner Ryomei Tanaka. The bout had to be stopped twice for Finol to tie his hair back as it got in the way.

Venezuela at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Men's road race,"Venezuela entered one rider, Orluis Aular, to compete in the men's Olympic road race, by virtue of his top 50 national finish (for men) in the UCI World Ranking. The race took place on 24 July 2021. Aular lives and trains in Spain, and was also the only representative for his road race team, Caja Rural.The men's race started at Musashinonomori Park in Chōfu, western Tokyo, and finished at the Fuji Speedway circuit in the Shizuoka Prefecture. The race was 234 kilometres (145 mi) long with a total elevation gain of 4,865 metres (15,961 ft). The conditions were 30 °C (86 °F) and overcast. The course first passed through the mostly flat outskirts of Tokyo's metropolitan area before a gradual climb towards the foot of the climb to Doushi Road. After 80 kilometres (50 mi) the cyclists topped out at an altitude of 1,121 metres (3,678 ft) above sea level at Lake Yamanakako in Yamanashi, then crossed the Kagosaka Pass and began the descent. The race then headed towards the lower slopes of Mount Fuji, taking the Fuji Sanroku path before a long descent into Gotemba. Following the Fuji mountain pass, the riders headed towards the Fuji Speedway section, making two laps before reaching the foot of the Mikuni Pass for another climb and a return to Lake Yamanakako and the Kagosaka Pass before a final descent and a short hilly section towards the finish on the Fuji Speedway circuit.
As soon as the race started, a group of eight riders broke away from the peloton, including Aular. The break reached a maximum advantage of around 20 minutes before the peloton began its pursuit, but they were unsuccessful on several attempts. The break was reduced to five riders – Aular, Nicholas Dlamini, Polychronis Tzortzakis, Michael Kukrle, and Juraj Sagan – after the first climb, ahead of the peloton by around 16 minutes. The break's lead gradually decreased as the climb went on, reaching the top of Fuji Sanroku with a lead of almost six minutes. This had dwindled to around four minutes as the leading group reached Fuji Speedway. During the speedway run, the peloton launched more chases of the lead group, which began to splinter as Sagan and Dlamini couldn't continue with the quick pace. The rest of the lead group was slowly consumed back into a much-decreased peloton during the second speedway pass, with Aular and Kukrle the last to be caught just as the group headed to Mikuni Pass.Aular was one of 41 cyclists who did not finish the course; he had headed the race in the leading group from the start for around 180 kilometres (110 mi), but had to withdraw due to exhaustion at 191 kilometres (119 mi). He returned to Europe after the race to compete in the Volta a Portugal beginning 4 August.",628
Venezuela at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Men's freestyle,"Venezuela automatically qualified for the men's BMX freestyle as one of the highest ranked at 2019 UCI Urban Cycling World Championships.The BMX freestyle competition is a two-round tournament, with a seeding round and a final. Each round has the cyclists perform two runs, which are 60 seconds long. Five judges give scores between 0.00 and 99.99 based on the difficulty and execution of the rider's run; the scores are averaged for a total run score. The scores in the seeding round are used to determine the start order of the cyclists in the final, with the top-seeding cyclists going last and the rest preceding in reverse order. In the final, only the best of the rider's two runs counts. The events took place at the Ariake Urban Sports Park.

Venezuelan cyclist Daniel Dhers, who has had the longest career in the sport and runs the North Carolina bike park where many Olympic BMX riders train, had helped BMX events become competitive in the late 1990s and, in the 21st century, advocated for it to be added to the Olympics, acting as the ""de facto spokesperson"" for BMX riders negotiating how the sport would transition. He said that having BMX in a competitive format on an international platform would encourage people to take up the sport as they watch the athletes have fun, as well as legitimize the sport to parents who can see a structured format and rules. He also said that the inclusion of BMX would be mutually beneficial, bringing a ""fresh look"" to the Olympics.When BMX freestyle was added to the Olympic program in 2017, Dhers expected it to not appear until the next Olympiad and debut at Paris 2024, by which time he had planned to retire. Being told that the event would appear at Japan 2020, he decided to stay in competition and try to qualify. During the Games he told CNN that he hopes to also compete at Paris.Dhers was the oldest competitor in the event, but was optimistic about his chances, saying: ""If I end up winning the Olympic gold, it would be for one of the smallest countries in one of the smallest sports just introduced into the Olympics - that would be insane."" Despite his age, a sport preview by Olympics.com noted him as one of the favorites along with Brandon Loupos of Australia and Rim Nakamura of Japan.
In seeding on 31 July, Dhers went fourth and placed third with an average 85.10 run, meaning he would perform third-last in the final. Dhers scored in the mid-80s in the seeding, having a first run of 84.20 and second of 86.00, slightly below second-placed Nakamura, while Australian Logan Martin achieved two runs scoring above 90.
Dhers improved on his seeding scores with two runs scoring above 90 in the final on 1 August; he started his first final run with a triple tailwhip and gap transfer, scoring 90.10 to sit in first on the leaderboard before Martin went out for his first run. Martin also improved on his seeding score, leading the event with 93.30. In the second run Declan Brooks and Kenneth Tencio beat Dhers's first run score; having to improve to get a medal, Dhers used more combination moves in his second run, packing his run full with flares and one-handed tricks. He achieved a 92.05 for this run, giving him the silver medal behind Martin, who crashed in his second run.At the Olympics, Dhers said:
I think it's been super important to be able to showcase freestyle BMX on the biggest stage in the world. BMX Freestyle has come a long way, we used to go out in the streets, kind of create havoc. Now, we are real athletes. The Olympics solidified that position for us. We take care of our body, we take care of our minds and we just love to do crazy tricks. I'm glad, I'm so psyched that people back at home are watching it, enjoying it because it's a beautiful sport. To me, it means the world that we finally made it to the big event.",861

Each dive is given a difficulty rating, and seven judges rank the execution of the dive out of 10 (in increments of 0.5); the three median execution scores are added together and multiplied by the difficulty to give the points for each dive.
Ariza went out in the preliminary round, placing 22nd with a total of 327.05, 219.85 points behind first-placed qualifier Yang Jian and 12.25 points behind the lowest reserve place scorer Isaac Souza.",224

Concerns were raised about the potential impact of the pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Olympic Games. In February 2020, Tokyo 2020 organizers insisted that the games would not be postponed or cancelled. They insisted that they were closely monitoring the spread of the disease. The IOC stated that their Japanese partners and then-prime minister Shinzo Abe ""made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest"".On 24 March 2020, the games, which were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, were postponed due to the pandemic.

2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Summary,"The opening ceremony of the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics took place on 23 July 2021 at Olympic Stadium, Tokyo, and was formally opened by Emperor Naruhito. As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings combined the formal and ceremonial opening of this international sporting event, including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes, with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation's culture and history. The majority of the artistic spectacle was pre-recorded, with live segments performed with a small VIP audience and performers adhering to social distancing. The ceremony marked the 125th anniversary of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens—the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games.
The theme of the Olympic Ceremonies is Moving Forward, referencing the global COVID-19 pandemic, with the opening ceremony theme being the Tokyo 2020 motto United by Emotion, which the organizers intended to ""reaffirm the role of sport and the value of the Olympic Games."" They focused on responses to the pandemic by the athlete community, including themes of lament, waiting and hope, and to congratulate front-line workers in the athlete community. They also showcased cultural points of Japan such as Japanese theater, video games, and variety shows, such as Kasou Taishou. For the first time in an Olympic opening ceremony, a moment of silence was observed in honor of Israeli athletes and officials murdered in the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics.",293
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,January 2017–December 2020: Original Plans,"The Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) gave the first report of preparations in December 2017, with the release of the ""Basic Policy"" document for the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies. The document was based upon feedback from experts and opinions of the Japanese public and includes the foundational elements for the positioning and overall concept of the four ceremonies. The Olympic opening ceremony is to introduce the themes and concepts of the four ceremonies, including peace, coexistence, reconstruction, the future, Japan and Tokyo, the athletes and involvement.Between July 2018 and December 2020, Mansai Nomura, an actor in traditional Japanese theater, was the chief creative director. Marco Balich of Balich Worldwide Shows, is the Senior Adviser to the Executive Producer. Balich was involved as producer of the ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics, 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2016 Summer Olympics, and has done other international ceremonies such as the 2019 Summer Universiade and the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima. In July 2019, he mentioned that his involvement will be in partnership with the Japanese advertising company Dentsu. Dentsu's creative director for these ceremonies, Kaoru Sugano, resigned in January 2020 over harassment claims.The new National Stadium, called Olympic Stadium during the Games, served as the main stadium for the opening ceremony. Demolition of old National Stadium was completed in May 2015. Construction of the new stadium began at the site on 11 December 2016. The stadium was handed over to the IOC on 30 November 2019 for preparations. Had the pandemic not happen, capacity of the stadium during the Olympic Games would have been 60,102, including account press and executive seating areas. Before the announcement of barring spectators was made, ticket prices for the Opening Ceremony were expected to range between ¥12,000 and ¥300,000.Previous Olympic opening ceremonies in Japan, such as the 1998 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Nagano, mixed ancient Japanese cultural elements with themes of international peace. Reports from Inside the Games and Kyodo News in January 2020 suggested that there would be a bigger focus on Japanese technology and its popular culture in this ceremony. According to reports from Shūkan Bunshun, the original program would include numerous references to J-pop and video games with the creative team led by MIKIKO before it was scaled back. The plan was to follow on with what was presented in the Rio 2016 closing ceremony, where then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dressed up as Mario in the handover segment.
According to the leak, the following artists, musicians, actors and cultural franchises were to appear in the ceremony:
The ceremony would have begun with an imitation of a scene in Akira manga where Kaneda is racing on a motorcycle;
Pop group Perfume were due to sing ""Welcome to Tokyo"" using computer generated imagery of the city's scenery and the mapping label of the Special wards of Tokyo;
Singer Daichi Miura was due to come from a wired frame car dressing as a staff member in Tokyo Station before his face turning into a tree;
Actress Tao Tsuchiya and Tomohiko Tsujimoto were due to dance in a scene representing vitality of Japanese nature scenery before a tree turned into an eye and a clock, with dancing duo AyaBambi to then dance in the middle of the clock;
Dancer Koharu Sugawara was to perform a traditional tea ceremony;
Dance group Tokyo Gegegay along with local high school students were due to perform with influences from the anime film Neo Tokyo;
The Japanese flag raising ceremony would have involved actor Mirai Moriyama holding a glowing bō stick using martial arts moves before children with lanterns would carry the Japanese flag;
Comedian Naomi Watanabe was to perform in a skit as an office worker stuck in a post-apocalyptic world mimicking a flashback of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Dancers with balls would have appeared with her and ""READY"" sign was to be shown before athletes entering the stadium;
Artist Lady Gaga was to make a special appearance;
Before the lighting of the flame, a segment featuring popular video games and anime would be performed before the lighting of the Olympic Flame, with Nintendo representatives including director and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto supervising the segment. Mario would have set to appear from a Warp Pipe, with appearances from well-known video game characters including Pac-Man, Pikachu from Pokémon and Sonic the Hedgehog, and anime characters Hello Kitty, Tsubasa Oozora from Captain Tsubasa, Doraemon and Goku from Dragon Ball. Mario would then reappear on a 8-bit with a group of dancers were to perform as various Olympic sports.",967
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,December 2020–July 2021: COVID-19 Impact,"In February 2020, after announcements concerning scaling back the Tokyo marathon due to the effects of COVID-19, health officials began to question whether the Olympic opening ceremony would also be impacted. On 24 March 2020, the IOC and the Tokyo Organizing Committee officially announced that due to the ongoing pandemic in Japan, the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be delayed to 2021, and held no later than Summer 2021 (marking the first time that an entire Olympics was postponed). On 30 March 2020, it was announced that the ceremony would take place on 23 July 2021.In December 2020, it was announced that Normura stepped down from Chief Creative Director as the original ceremony team disbanded, and Hiroshi Sasaki was announced as the new director. Normura became an advisor. At the press conference, Sasaki pointed out that the previous plans were scrapped as it was considered too extravagant, which suggested that it would be simplified as per audience expectations.In March 2021, Sasaki resigned after making a derogatory comment about Japanese comedian and fashion icon Naomi Watanabe. The reports came a month after Yoshirō Mori, president of the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, resigned over derogatory comments made about female members of the committee. Since March 2021 until 22 July 2021, Kentarō Kobayashi was made chief creative director, with Takayuki Hioki, managing director of Sports Branding Japan, promoted to deputy chief ceremonies officer and executive producer.During organizing talks in late 2020, concerns were raised over who could attend the Opening Ceremony. In July 2021, the organizers agreed that the ceremony would be performed with no live audience, except for competing athletes if they choose to attend, a maximum of six officials for each country's delegation, and invited VIP guests. Much of the artistic and cultural sections of the ceremony will adhere to social distancing guidelines, and the majority of segments will be pre-recorded.In a press release released on 14 July 2021, the committee announced the themes and the creative team for the opening and closing of the Olympics and Paralympics. The theme of the Olympic ceremonies would be called ""Moving Forward"" referencing the world recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. The creative team state that they ""have designed the ceremonies around the concept that the Games can bring fresh hope and encouragement to people around the world through the active appearance of athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Games and via the power of sport."" This was expected, as just after the postponement in March 2020, Balich said that the crisis would be mentioned at some point during the ceremony due to its significance at the games.In that same press release, it found that they appointed Keigo Oyamada of Cornelius as one of the composers. The appointment prompted criticism on social media due to Oyamada's past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome. Oyamada admitted the disability abuse in interviews that resurfaced after his appointment. On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, the Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, which was questioned for insight and good sense, announced their support for him to continue as a composer. Toshirō Mutō, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, said he wanted Oyamada to remain involved. However, on 19 July, Oyamada formally apologized, resigned and withdrew his music from the ceremony.On 22 July 2021, the day before the ceremony, Kentarō Kobayashi, the chief creative director of the ceremonies after Sasaki resigned, was fired by the organizing committee for making jokes about the Holocaust in a comedy routine in 1998, and the committee asked for a review of the ceremony content before it was performed. That evening, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who serves as the Supreme Advisor and Chairperson of the Organizing Committee, described Kobayashi's Holocaust jokes as ""outrageous and unacceptable"", but also said that the opening ceremony, prepared and directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned.",820

""In the Opening Ceremony, we will aspire to reaffirm the role of sport and the value of the Olympic Games, to express our gratitude and admiration for the efforts we all made together over the past year, and also to bring a sense of hope for the future"", said Tokyo 2020. ""We hope it will be an experience that conveys how we all have the ability to celebrate differences, to empathise, and to live side by side with compassion for one another."" Although the creative director of the ceremony, Kentarō Kobayashi, was fired on the day before the ceremony due to the past jokes of The Holocaust, the organising committee decided to hold the ceremony how it had been prepared and directed by him.",320

After the Japanese National Anthem was sung, a tribute was paid for those who had died from COVID-19, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and especially for the victims of the Munich 1972 massacre, one year before the 50th anniversary of that massacre. The actor Mirai Moriyama appeared up dressed in white and, after striking a pose of mourning, performed a butō dance in the middle of the stadium, while tenebrous and funereal music played. Subsequently, a moment of silence was observed at the culmination of this section of the ceremony.",301
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,A Lasting Legacy,"The unveiling of the Olympic Rings, which were made from trees planted from seeds during the 1964 Olympics, followed. It starred tap-dancing performers wearing hanten coats, which were traditionally worn by Edo-era craftspeople and carpenters and evoked Japanese summertime festivals, at which this style of clothing is common, as they built what has either been described as a mock Olympic Village or a matsuri, as the rings were brought while being surrounded by Japanese paper lanterns.A pre-recorded video was shown of Muhammad Yunus receiving the Olympic Laurel award in Bangladesh, because Yunus could not travel to Japan due to travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in that country.",149
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Parade of Nations,"The Parade of Nations followed with the team delegations marching into the stadium. 
Before the athletes marched, a videotaped section was shown showcasing how the world trained for these challenging Olympics.
Athletes entered the stadium in an order dictated by the Olympic tradition. As the originator of the Olympics, the Greek team entered first. Other teams entered in order of the Gojūon system based on the names of countries in the Japanese language, the first time this happened as previous Olympics held in Japan have used the English language. Following tradition, the delegation from the host nation Japan entered last.
The Refugee Olympic Team, composed of refugees from several countries, was the second nation to enter, after Greece. For the first time ever in the opening ceremony, the countries that will host the next two Olympic Games, France (in 2024) and the United States (in 2028), marched immediately before the host nation Japan entered, instead of entering one-hundred-fifty-fourth (between Brazil and Bulgaria) and seventh (between Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates), respectively, according to the Japanese alphabet order. 
The names of the teams were announced in French, followed by English and Japanese, the official languages of the Olympic movement and the host nation, in accordance with traditional and International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines.
Each of the signboards displaying the countries' names was written in Japanese on one side and English on the other, enclosed in speech balloons, evoking manga panels, while the signholders' costumes had manga tones.The athletes themselves attended in low numbers compared to previous Olympics, as out of Team USA's 613 and Australia's 472, only about 200 and 63 attended, respectively.In their entrances, several teams, including Argentina and Ghana, broke into song, while the Twitter account for the Games pointed out an Eritrean athlete who laid down on the ground, which other athletes had done as well while looking at their phones. As Russia had been banned to partake in sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency, Russian athletes marched under the ROC designation and flag. Japan inverted the colours of the uniform they had used in the 1964 Olympics, while France paraded in three rows, representing the tricolor flag. Two flagbearers, Tonga's Pita Taufatofua and Vanautu's Riilio Rii, paraded shirtless and oiled. Noticeably, several members of the Kyrgyz and Tajik delegations as well as the Pakistani flagbearers entered the ceremony maskless. During the parade of nations, Mohamad Maso of Syria was reunited with his brother, Alaa, who represented the IOC Refugee Olympic Team.For the first time, each team had the option to allow two flag bearers, one male and one female, in an effort to promote gender equality.Before the athletes paraded in, a sign inside the stadium pointed out that the athletes should keep social distance between themselves and how far was the entrance as well as the restroom.In addition, 19 tracks from popular Japanese video game series were also used during the duration of the two hour-long segment, these being:

These also became the last parade involving Afghanistan before the Taliban re-invasion of Kabul several weeks after the games.",674
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,A New Motto and Oath,"The Parade of Nations finished with the projection of the Olympic motto, ""Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together"" in the middle of the stadium floor, between the athletes, which were organised into quadrants after they marched in. A message from Kirsty Coventry, the outgoing chair of the IOC Athletes' Commission was played, introducing the new Olympic Oath with the aim of promoting inclusion and the role of Athletes, Judges and Coaches as ambassadors. The following oath was delivered by 6 participants from the Tokyo delegation:
We promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play, inclusion and equality. Together we stand in solidarity and commit ourselves to sport without doping, without cheating, without any form of discrimination. We do this for the honour of our teams, in respect for the Fundamental Principles of Olympism, and to make the world a better place through sport.",195
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Imagine,"Groups of all ages entered the stadium dancing around boxes, which were organised into three circles and then into the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 emblem logo. Then, mirroring the previous segment, 1,824 drones made a 3D rendition of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 emblem logo over the stadium and then the globe of Earth with its continents.Following this what Time Out Japan called an ""emotional montage"", featuring a ""half-live, half-recorded performance"" of ""Imagine"", composed by John Lennon, was sung by Angélique Kidjo (Africa), Alejandro Sanz (Europe), John Legend (Americas), and Keith Urban (Oceania), all of whom joined remotely via pre-recorded material; plus the Suginami Junior Chorus, who was live in the stadium. It was arranged by Hans Zimmer, and had musical support provided by TAIKOPROJECT and the Synchron Stage Orchestra and Stage Choir. ""Imagine"" had previously appeared at other Olympic ceremonies, including the 1996 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in Atlanta, the 2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Torino, the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London, and the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in PyeongChang.",249
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Peace Through Sport,"Seiko Hashimoto, President of the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and Thomas Bach, IOC president, then gave speeches. Hashimoto briefly spoke about the Tokyo Olympics as an example of overcoming difficulties, as the pitch to host the Olympics was for it to form part of the rebuilding effort after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. She also called for the Olympic Truce to be observed. Bach in his 13 minute speech, highlighted that the Olympic movement showed the unifying power of sport, and expressed his gratitude to healthcare workers, the volunteers and described participating refugee athletes as an enrichment for society. Both speeches were scheduled to last a combined total of nine minutes, but in the ceremony the segment took over twice as long.The opening declaration of the 2020 Olympic Games, limited to a prescribed statement of around 17 words, laid down in the Olympic Charter, was made by Emperor Naruhito. He was the third Japanese Emperor to open an Olympics, following his grandfather Emperor Hirohito (1964 Summer and 1972 Winter Olympics) and his father Emperor Akihito (1998 Winter Olympics). He was also the honorary patron of Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympics. After Naruhito declared the Games open, 288 fireworks were set off.The Olympic Flag then entered the stadium. Many of the flag bearers were both athletes and front-line nurses, doctors and healthcare workers during the pandemic. The flag bearers were:
Asia: Kento Momota, Badminton
Oceania: Elena Galiabovitch, Shooter and Physician
Americas: Paula Pareto, Judoka and Physician
Africa: Mehdi Essadiq, Triathlon
Europe: Paola Egonu, Volleyball
IOC Refugee Olympic Team: Cyrille Tchatchet II, Weightlifter and NurseIt was then handed to front line workers from Japan and was raised by the Japan Guard. The Olympic Anthem was sung in English by the choir composed of high school students from Tokyo and Fukushima.Finally, while an English recording of Susan Boyle performing the Japanese folk song Tsubasa o Kudasai (Wings to Fly) played, doves were projected on the stadium floor, before thousands of paper doves fluttered into the stadium.",468
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Let the Games Begin & Time to Shine,"A video sequence showed the history of the Olympic pictograms had been introduced at the Olympic Games 1964 (also in Tokyo), followed by a live-action recreation of the 50 pictograms used for the events of this Olympic Games. Out of the 50 pictograms, 48 were acted out by the performers using camera angles and various props, some done live in the middle of the stadium, others in prerecorded segments additionally with hand gestures, finger tutting, studio lights, and karate gi. During one prerecorded segment, parts of the song ""Camptown Races"" could be briefly heard while the equestrian-related pictograms were recreated. The first pictogram shown, the one for the modern pentathlon, was initially depicted as a static image before the performer portraying the running figure moved out of place, setting up the nature of the performance, while the one for sailing was found printed on a propsman's shirt. The segment was directed by HIRO-PON, (from Gamarjobat)  with the segment being called ""a funny, witty performance reminiscent of a typical Japanese TV game show"" like Kasou Taishou.Following this, a lighting technician played by the comedian Hitori Gekidan was seen on camera to switch on the lights for several Tokyo and national landmarks across Japan. The Olympic champion and former figure skater Shizuka Arakawa was also involved in this sketch.
A performance by kabuki actor Ichikawa Ebizō XI, acting out an excerpt from Shibaraku, was accompanied by jazz pianist Hiromi Uehara, playing a rendition of a tune from her album Spectrum. The segment, ""intended to dispel negative energy,"" symbolised the mixing of both traditional Japanese performing arts and the Japanese affection towards modern jazz.",374
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Hope Lights Our Way,"Before the flame arrived at the stadium, a recap video played showcasing the flame's journey across Japan featuring the song Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together) performed by Queen. The flame was brought into the stadium at the end of the torch relay by wrestler Saori Yoshida and judoka Tadahiro Nomura. It was carried by a trio of Japanese baseball greats (Shigeo Nagashima, Sadaharu Oh, and Hideki ""Godzilla"" Matsui), a doctor and a nurse, paralympian Wakako Tsuchida, and a group of students from Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures who were born shortly before the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Finally Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka carried it up the steps to light the Olympic cauldron; Osaka herself would compete for Japan in the Olympics before being eliminated in the third round of the women's tennis competition. Three hours later, the badminton player Ayaka Takahashi lit another cauldron, outside the stadium which was off–limits to guests.In December 2018, organisers had stated that although the Olympic cauldron would be officially lit and extinguished at the stadium, the flame would be transferred to a separate, public cauldron (following the lead of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio) at Ariake West Canal, on the Tokyo riverfront while the Games were in progress, and transferred back to Olympic Stadium for the closing ceremony. Organisers cited ""physical difficulties"" to keeping the flame at the New National Stadium due to the current japanese legislation about fire efects use.  Due to the state of emergency, the cauldron was off-limits to guests and situated outside the Olympic Stadium.The cauldron was designed by Canadian-Japanese designer Oki Sato, who attended Waseda University, the same university as Yoshinori Sakai, the cauldron-lighter in 1964. The steps to reach the cauldron, symbolising Mount Fuji, were ""designed to evoke the image of a blooming sakura flower.""The music featured in the cauldron lighting included Boléro by Maurice Ravel, ""Rise of the Planet 9"" from Dr. Copellius, composed by Isao Tomita, followed by the fireworks featuring the music of Takashi Yoshimatsu's Symphony No. 2 ""At terra"".",496
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Dignitaries in attendance,"Even though the stadium had normally had a capacity for 68,000 spectators, however only 800 foreign and 150 local officials, who were deemed ""Games stakeholders"", were in attendance, as well as 3,500 members of the media and 6,000 members of team delegations, totalling 10,400. Even though it is customary for Olympic sponsors to send corporate representatives as well, companies such as Toyota, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, NEC, and Fujitsu, opted out of attending. A scoreboard in the stadium warned the attendees to ""Clap, Do not sing or chant"".",123

2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Controversies,"Outside the venue, protesters' opposing the Olympics being run during the pandemic was held in the southwestern corner of the Stadium, timed so that it would coincide with the ceremony. The protestors' chant, ""Go to hell, IOC,"" could be heard by media inside the stadium during some of the quieter moments.Another scandal involving musicians was the dropping of the Senegalese-born Japanese percussionist, Latyr Sy, allegedly due to the organizers' reticence in having an ""African"" in the ceremony. He had been hired in May and had the rehearsal schedule sent to him in April, however, upon enquiring about signing his contract in May, he was informed that his inclusion in the program had been rejected due to his ethnicity. A spokesperson of the organising committee later gave background to Sy's claim saying, ""We had planned a music part in which many singers would participate, but due to infectious disease control and budget, we cancelled the part itself. Therefore we cancelled the appearance of all the participants in the music part.""When Emperor Naruhito began the opening declaration, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Governor of Tokyo Yuriko Koike remained seated, and only stood halfway through. On Japanese social media, some criticized their confusion as disrespectful to the Emperor. Governor Koike spoke later to press that he felt embarrassed standing up half way through. The organizing committee later apologized for the wording at the end of Thomas Bach speech as he could not make an announcement in the stadium to encourage everyone to stand up before the Emperor spoke.",314
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Reception,"The ceremony was panned as being solemn and muted in comparison to previous Olympic ceremonies, with the lack of audience due to the state of emergency being a factor in the atmosphere, to the point that journalist Ian Dunt compared it to attending a funeral. It was also largely panned for being too long and confusing. Japanese Entertainment writer Elizabeth Matsumoto was confused by some elements of the ceremony such as the Matsuri segment, questioning why to focus on carpentry and if the tap dancing was necessary. Others criticized Bach's 13 minute speech where some athletes sat down during the segment.Those who understood that the ceremony would be more muted, such as Jen Chaney from Vulture, opined that while it was largely entertaining and showed the perseverance of the human spirit, it also showed the pessimism and difficulties of holding the Summer Olympics during a pandemic, summarizing the theme of the ceremony as asking the question ""What exactly are we doing here, and why?""Some did give positive reviews to the celebratory segments, including a segment featuring dancers re-creating the poses of the Games' pictograms. Moreover, some Japanese reviewers felt that Misia's performance of the Japanese Anthem was excellent and dignified given the difficulties of performing the anthem live. Others felt that the ceremony showed a unmistakably contemporary and diverse view of Japan, finishing with Osaka lighting the cauldron, who is biracial and has opened up about her mental health.",293
2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Broadcasting,"In Japan, state broadcaster NHK aired the opening ceremony in 8K with 22.2 surround sound and hybrid log-gamma (HLG) HDR. Despite wide opposition to the Olympics by residents, the opening ceremony was seen in Japan by at least 73.27 million viewers nationwide, with NHK peaking at a 61% audience share during a segment featuring Miki Maya and at the start of the parade of nations.

Locally, it was reported that the opening ceremony had achieved a 56% audience share in the Kantō region, making it the most-watched television broadcast in the region since the opening ceremony of the 1964 Summer Olympics.South Korean broadcaster MBC faced criticism for showing profiles of countries with insensitive or stereotypical facts and images during the parade of nations, such as Italy being represented by a picture of pizza, Portugal being represented by a picture of egg tarts, Romania represented by a picture of Dracula, Ukraine represented by a photo of the Chernobyl disaster, Syria's profile mentioning the Syrian civil war, and Haiti described as having an ""unstable political situation due to the assassination of the president"". MBC CEO Park Sung-jae apologized for the imagery, stating that the network had ""damaged the Olympic values of friendship, solidarity and harmony"" with the images, which had been intended to help viewers identify the countries.In the United States, NBC announced that it would broadcast and stream the opening ceremony live in all time zones, (6:55 a.m. Eastern/3:55 a.m. Pacific) in addition to its traditional tape-delayed prime time broadcasts.

Tokyo bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics,Applicant City phase,"Tokyo was selected by the Japanese Olympic Committee on July 16, 2011 as Japan's bidding city for the 2020 Games. The city moved forward with its bid following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami which affected much of eastern Japan. Prior to Tokyo's selection by the Japanese Olympic Committee, Hiroshima expressed interest in hosting but withdrew their plans to bid.On September 7, 2011, the Japanese Olympic Committee announced that Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara will be Chairman of the Tokyo 2020 bid committee. The bid committee held their first meeting shortly after. Towards the end of November 2011 the Tokyo 2020 Council was established. It is an advisory board comprises 64 members including Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda who is the top advisor on the council. Tokyo 2020 revealed their bid logo on November 30, 2011. Tokyo's 2020 bid would have a budget of $75 million, which is half the amount of their previous 2016 bid, which had a $150 million budget. The President of the Japanese Olympic Committee, Tsunekazu Takeda, stated in April 2012 that hosting the games could generate $2 billion for Tokyo.In early December 2011, Japan's House of Representatives and House of Councillors passed a resolution giving Tokyo's bid their full support and cooperation. This decision also stated that hosting the games would be beneficial to Japan and would be a positive step forward following the recent earthquake and tsunami that Japan experienced earlier in 2011. The Cabinet followed by giving the bid its support. The bid had full backing of the government.In January 2012 polls suggested that nearly 66% of the country supports the bid.Tokyo 2020 appointed Yuko Arakida as its Sports Director in February 2012. Ayano Egami who won a silver medal in synchronized swimming at the 2000 Summer Olympics will serve as head of online and social media for the bid.In April 2012, Tokyo 2020 appointed Tokuaki Suzuki, as the bid's communications director.

Tokyo bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics,Candidate City phase,"On May 23, 2012, the IOC selected Tokyo as a Candidate City for the 2020 Summer Olympics.In June 2012 a study was conducted that found that hosting the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo could create over 150,000 jobs. In July 2012, the bid launched their ""Discover Tomorrow"" slogan. In November, a survey revealed that 67% of Tokyo's population supported Tokyo's Olympic bid.Also in November 2012, the new design for the redeveloped National Olympic Stadium was revealed. The venue will be used for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Tokyo 2020 submitted their candidature file to the IOC on January 7, 2013.A poll in January 2013 found that 73% of Tokyo residents were in favor of the bid. Another poll found that 78% of Japanese surveyed supported bringing the games to Tokyo. This result showed an increase in support compared to earlier polls. A poll carried out by Yomiuri Shimbun found that 83% of the country supported the bid. Tokyo's previous bid for the 2016 Games had lower public support with one poll indicating that 56% of residents supported the 2016 bid. The IOC Evaluation Commission visited Tokyo from March 4 to March 7, 2013.In April 2013, the Tokyo 2020 Chairman, Governor Naoki Inose, created controversy when he made a comment that was seen as a criticism of Istanbul and their bid for the 2020 Olympics. Inose said, “Well, compare the two countries where they have yet to build infrastructure, very sophisticated facilities. So from time to time, like Brazil, I think it’s good to have a venue for the first time. But Islamic countries, the only thing they share in common is Allah and they are fighting with each other and they have classes.” Criticizing rival bids are forbidden under IOC rules. Following Inose's statement, Tokyo 2020 made a statement saying that they ""have the utmost respect for all candidate cities and have always taken pride in bidding in a spirit based on the Olympic values of excellence, respect and friendship.”  Inose apologized for his comments a few days later and stated that he was ""fully committed"" to respecting IOC rules.At the Association of National Olympic Committees Extraordinary General Assembly in June 2013, Tokyo 2020 stressed the compactness of their bid. 85% of the competition venues would be within 8 km of the Olympic Village. Two anonymous sources within the IOC stated that Tokyo is the favorite to win their Olympic bid over Istanbul and Madrid provided no major mistakes were made before the IOC vote. The safe and secure nature of Tokyo was seen as a major factor giving the Tokyo bid an advantage. Istanbul had already seen large anti-government protests while Madrid's bid was said to have been affected by Spain's economic crisis.The 2020 IOC Evaluation Commission Report on the Candidate Cities for the 2020 Summer Olympics was released on June 25. Tokyo 2020 gave a presentation of their bid to the IOC at an Extraordinary session in Lausanne in July 2013.In August 2013, Naoki Inose stated that the 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant would not pose a threat to Tokyo's ability to host the Olympic Games. Inose stated that ""the water in Tokyo is safe, and we have released this data on our website"" and that ""The radiation levels are no different than in London or Paris."" A letter of assurance over the issue was later sent to the IOC members.",685

Modern pentathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Format,"Modern pentathlon contains five events; pistol shooting, épée fencing, 200.0 metres (656.2 ft) freestyle swimming, show jumping, and a 3.200 kilometres (1.988 mi) cross-country run.The first three events (fencing, swimming, and show jumping) were scored on a points system. Those points were then converted into a time handicap for the final combined event (pistol shooting and cross-country running), with the points leader starting first and each other competitor having a delayed start based on how many points behind the leader they were. This results in the finish order of the run being the final ranking for the event.
Similar to the previous Games, the fencing event consisted of two rounds: the traditional round-robin stage plus a ""bonus round."" In the round-robin, each competitor faced every other competitor in a one-touch bout. The competitors were ranked according to how many victories they earn. The bonus round was held on one piste in a ladder, knock-out system. The two lowest-ranked competitors from the round-robin faced each other in another one-touch bout; the winner was credited with the additional point (round-robin victories being worth 6 points) and advanced to face the next-lowest ranked competitor. This continued, up the ranking ladder, until all competitors had competed in the bonus round.The swimming portion consisted of a 200-metre freestyle race, with score based on time.The show jumping competition involved riding an unfamiliar horse over a course with 12 obstacles. The score was based on penalties for fallen bars, refusals, falls, and being over the time limit. Following the show jumping in Tokyo concerns were raised regarding the poor horsemanship of some of the competitors and the ethics of this section of the competition; resulting in Modern Pentathlon's governing body promising a review. The running and pistol shooting events were combined in the laser-run as they have been since 2012: athletes face four rounds of shooting, each followed by an 800 metre (874.9 yards) run. In each round of shooting, they shoot laser pistols at targets 10 meters away. Competitors must hit five targets, or have 50 seconds elapse, before they can move to the next leg of the run; there is no additional penalty for missed shots. Because the athletes have staggered starts based on the first three events, the first athlete to cross the finish line is the winner.",510
Modern pentathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Qualification,"Thirty-six athletes are eligible to qualify for each of the two events; a maximum of two per gender from any nation. Qualification methods are the same for both the men's and women's events.The host nation Japan has been guaranteed a single place each in the men's and women's events, while two invitational places will be allocated by UIPM once the rest of the qualifiers were decided.Between February and August 2019, the initial distribution of quotas to the athletes has taken place based on the competition results.

So that, for example, for golf, boxing, and other things that can be expressed only by the upper body he does not draw the lower body. On the other hand, he says he pursued realism and activity in simplicity. The evolution of the pictograms to show the dynamics and reality of athletes is, for example, that ""I studied body movements and made the torso white in many sports.

Two qualification boulders were leaked on YouTube; the video was quickly taken down and the boulders were reset.",128
Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Format,"On August 3, 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) formally announced that sport climbing would be a medal sport in the 2020 Summer Olympics. The inclusion was proposed by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) in 2015.The decision to combine three disciplines of lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing with one set of medals per gender caused widespread criticism in the climbing world.Climber Lynn Hill said the decision to include speed climbing was like ""asking a middle distance runner to compete in the sprint."" Czech climber Adam Ondra, who later competed as a finalist at the Olympics, voiced similar sentiments in an interview stating that anything would be better than this combination. There is some overlap between athletes in the categories of lead climbing and bouldering, but speed climbing is usually seen as a separate discipline which is practiced by specialized athletes. Climber Shauna Coxsey stated, ""No boulderer has transitioned to speed and lead, and no speed climber has done it to bouldering and lead.""Members of the IFSC explained that they were only granted one gold medal per gender by the Olympic committee and they did not want to exclude speed climbing. The IFSC's goal for the 2020 Olympics was primarily to establish climbing and its three disciplines as Olympic sports; changes to the format could follow later. This tactic proved to be successful as they were granted a second set of medals for the 2024 Summer Olympics, where speed climbing will be a separate event from the combined event of lead climbing and bouldering.The final rankings were calculated by multiplying the climbers' rankings in each discipline, with the best score being the lowest one.",333

He stated that Turkey's fast growing economy can also greatly benefit the bid.In January 2012, Istanbul 2020 sent a delegation to the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics in Innsbruck to help promote the bid.In March 2012, Istanbul successfully hosted the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships, which is seen as a positive step forward for Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Olympics.In March 2012, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan stated that Turkey is also interested in bidding to host the 2020 UEFA European Football Championship. Turkey bid to host UEFA Euro 2016 but lost to France by one vote. In April 2012, Turkey submitted a bid to host the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship. Istanbul 2020 has stated that the Olympic bid still has the support of the government. On May 8, 2012, IOC President Jacques Rogge stated that if Istanbul is awarded the 2020 Olympics that they would have to withdraw as hosts of UEFA Euro 2020.

So from time to time, like in Brazil, I think it’s good to have a venue for the first time. But Islamic countries, the only thing they share in common is Allah and they are fighting with each other and they have classes.” Criticizing rival bids are forbidden under IOC rules. Following Inose's statement, Tokyo 2020 made a statement saying that they ""have the utmost respect for all candidate cities and have always taken pride in bidding in a spirit based on the Olympic values of excellence, respect, and friendship.” Inose apologized for his comments a few days later and stated that he was ""fully committed"" to respecting IOC rules.In June 2013, Istanbul mayor Kadir Topbaş gave an interview expressing concern that the police's actions following an anti-government protest would jeopardize Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, saying ""As Istanbul's mayor going through such an event, the fact that the whole world watched saddens me. How will we explain it? With what claims will we host the 2020 Olympic Games?"" Istanbul 2020 released a statement saying that ""despite these recent events, all sections of Turkey remain united in our dream to host our nation’s first-ever Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020."" IOC President Jacques Rogge stated that these events would not negatively impact the city's bid. IOC Presidential Candidate Thomas Bach also stated that he did not believe that these events would hurt the bid. The President of the NOCT, Uğur Erdener stated that these events would strengthen the bid.

Doha bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics,History,"On August 7, 2008, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, the Heir Apparent of Qatar, revealed that the Qatar would bid for the 2020 Games. Sheikh Tamim, who is also the chairman of the Qatar Olympic Committee, said that Qatar was determined to learn from the lessons of its failed 2016 bid, and ""bid for hosting the Olympic Games in 2020 as per set measures and standards."" Doha bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics but failed to become a candidate. The IOC cited technical reasons for its rejection of the bid, including Doha's insistence on holding the Games in October, because of its unsuitably hot weather in August. The 2016 Games were ultimately awarded to Rio de Janeiro. Doha once again proposed to the IOC that the games be organized in autumn rather than the summer due to Qatar's extremely hot summer weather. In August 2011 the IOC and the Qatar bid team held talks after which Doha was given permission to host the games outside the traditional timeframe. Thus Doha made their bid official.Doha's Olympic bid proposed to hold the games outside of the traditional summer period for the games (July 15-August 31) and placing them between September and October, which would avoid Doha's midsummer period of very hot weather. Qatar was awarded the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup on December 2, 2010. Several of the stadiums for the World Cup will be located in Doha. Doha hosted the 2006 Asian Games, 2011 Pan Arab Games and hosted multiple matches of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.
Upon being accepted as an Applicant City, the IOC asked Doha to take steps to ensure the health of athletes should Doha be selected, and the IOC was to publish a list of events which must take place in the morning or late afternoon due to the heat that the city experiences. The IOC gave assurances that these changes would not negatively affect the organization of the games or the international broadcasts of the games. The IOC also requested a plan be drawn up to protect the health of the public in attendance and the staff who would help out at the games. IOC President Jacques Rogge said that no outdoor sports would be able to take place between 10 am and 6 pm due to the heat. The IOC consulted its own medical experts and International Federations in regard to Qatar's heat. They agreed that outdoor sports would need to take place in the early morning and evening. The IOC studied the logistics of arranging broadcasts of events.On October 1, 2011 it was announced that Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, who serves as President of the Qatar Olympic Committee and is an IOC member would head the Doha 2020 bid committee. Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani and Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani will serve as vice presidents of the bid committee.On October 12, 2011 Doha 2020 appointed Vero Communications and Andrew Craig as the bid's lead advisors.As 2011 drew to a close, the bid received the support of the leaders of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which gave the bid the full support of the Gulf Cooperation Council.In January 2012, the Doha 2020 delegation went to Innsbruck for the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics and stated the support for the games.

Doha 2020 unveil their bid logo, slogan and website on February 10, 2012. Their bid slogan was ""Inspiring Change"", to highlight the changes taking place in the Middle East over the previous year.In April 2012, Doha's Olympic bid received a boost when the city was awarded the 2014 FINA World Swimming Championships.

Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal,Background,"Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has a particular interest in sports, treating it as an ideological basis of his leadership, and athletes are more likely to be targets of Lukashenko according to Amnesty International because athletes are favoured by the state; as such, speaking out is considered more treacherous. A number of Belarusian athletes have been directly critical of Lukashenko, and some were banned and imprisoned for participating in protests.On 7 December 2020, following allegations of athlete intimidation and even torture, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced several provisional measures being taken against the National Olympic Committee for the Republic of Belarus (NOC RB). Among these measures was the banning of the NOC RB Executive Board ""from all IOC events and activities, including the Olympic Games"". The President of the Executive Board at the time was Alexander Lukashenko, while the First Vice-President of the board was his eldest son, Viktor Lukashenko. The measures were set to expire once the NOC RB Executive Board held its elections in late February 2021. These elections resulted in Viktor holding the dual role of President and First Vice-President of the board. Two weeks later, on 8 March, the IOC renewed their previous measures against the NOC BR Executive Board in addition to adding new measures.Going into the 2020 Summer Olympics, three Belarusian athletes were disqualified for not undergoing the required number of drug tests in preparation for the Olympics.",288

She then decided not to return, and she recorded another video from the airport.The Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation (BSSF) called for journalists and members of the Belarusian diaspora in Japan to meet Tsimanouskaya at the airport. She drew the attention of police officers at the airport terminal, who took her into protective custody at an airport hotel overnight. Tsimanouskaya said to journalists that she was afraid of returning to Belarus, and she intended to claim asylum in Austria, where she often trains.",203

On 2 August, she entered the Polish embassy in Tokyo, where she and her husband, fellow sprinter Arseniy Zdanevich were granted humanitarian visas to the country. Zdanevich had fled to Ukraine after he heard the news, saying that he did not think twice about leaving Belarus, claiming however that he and Tsimanouskaya were completely apolitical: ""We never had any connections, never supported the opposition. We're just normal sports people, we're just devoted to sports and we're not interested in the opposition movement.""The IOC confirmed that they were also safeguarding Tsimanouskaya and that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was involved. The Japanese government also assured her safety. On 3 August, she was granted a humanitarian visa in Japan, and Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi reported that she was in a ""safe situation"".Though most of western Europe had offered her protection by 2 August, Tsimanouskaya reportedly chose to seek asylum in Poland as the country had expressly offered her the opportunity to continue competing; the IOC made contact with officials from the Polish Olympic Committee (PKOI) on 3 August regarding Tsimanouskaya resuming competition. On 4 August, Tsimanouskaya flew to Warsaw Chopin Airport, where she was met by Polish officials as well as Belarusian expatriates carrying carnations, a symbol of resistance, and the white-red-white flag of Belarus, which was officially flown from 1991 to 1995 and has been widely used during the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests.",342
Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal,Reception in Belarus,"Despite Zdanevich's assurance that Tsimanouskaya was apolitical, many Belarusian government supporters sent her threatening messages; the BSSF determined her life would be in danger if she returned to Belarus and encouraged her to travel to Poland. The state-owned Belarusian network Belarus-1 reported on 31 July that she was removed from the team for being unsportsmanlike, saying that she was ""lazy"", ""foul-bred"", and ""unpatriotic"", and did not deserve to represent Belarus; it also criticized the strictness of the IOC which prohibited the original relay runners from competing.The NOC RB, which withdrew Tsimanouskaya from competition following the Instagram video, said on 1 August that it was concerned by the athlete's ""emotional and psychological state ... according to doctors"". Tsimanouskaya said she did not see any doctors.",182
Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal,Other athletes,"Several fellow Belarusian athletes have spoken in support of Tsimanouskaya, while others have condemned her. Some contacted by The Guardian declined to talk, also wanting to steer clear of politics. On 4 August, Belarusian athletes Yana Maksimava and Andrei Krauchanka also announced they would not return to the country but would seek refuge in Germany, where they train. Krauchanka has previously been detained in Belarus for taking part in protests.",95
Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal,IOC investigation,"On 3 August, the IOC launched an investigation of the incident, demanding a report from the NOC RB by the end of the day explaining why they attempted to repatriate Tsimanouskaya. A disciplinary commission, during which Tsimanouskaya was set to testify, was planned for 6 August. On this day, as part of the investigation, the IOC revoked the accreditation of two Belarusian delegates, head athletics coach Yuri Moisevich and team official Artur Shimak, who were asked to leave the Olympic Village. The IOC added that they will have an opportunity ""to be heard"". President of the IOC Thomas Bach and the Japanese foreign ministry both gave statements on 6 August describing what happened to Tsimanouskaya as ""deplorable"" and ""unjust"".",159
Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal,Sanctions,"The United States, Canada, and United Kingdom implemented coordinated financial sanctions against Belarus on 9 August. Lukashenko was critical towards the UK and Canada, calling the nations ""America's lapdogs"", telling them to choke on their sanctions, and saying he would rather have talks with the West than engage in a sanctions war. On the same day, the European Union (EU) said it may leverage more sanctions, as Belarus had continued to defy international recommendations, on the same day, citing the case of Tsimanouskaya among other incidents since 9 August 2020.On 3 February 2022, the United States imposed visa restrictions on Belarusian nationals involved in extraterritorial counter-dissident activity, including the Olympics scandal, under the Khashoggi Ban.",155
Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal,Belarusian response to sanctions,"Following its granting of visas to Tsimanouskaya and her husband, Poland said that Belarus, which the EU has previously accused of state-sponsored facilitation of human trafficking and migrant smuggling, started sending migrants it had flown in from the Middle East into Poland as a political weapon. On 5 August, the EU summoned Belarusian officials to Brussels to explain, with the European Commission warning Lukashenko to stop using migrants as tools.On 9 August, the one-year anniversary of his controversial re-election, Lukashenko held a lengthy conference in Minsk, saying that he believed Tsimanouskaya would not have made the allegations herself and asserting she had been manipulated by people in Poland.",144

The newer AIBA Pro Boxing Tournament, consisting of pros who sign 5 year contracts with AIBA and compete on pro cards leading up to the tournament, also provides a pathway for new pros to retain their Olympic eligibility and retain ties with national committees. The elimination of headgear and the adoption of the ""10-point must"" scoring system further clears the delineation between amateur and pro format.The number of weight classes for men was reduced from ten to eight, with a featherweight class introduced and events at light-flyweight (introduced in 1968), bantamweight (staged at every Olympics since 1904 bar 1912, when boxing events weren't held) and light-welterweight (introduced in 1952) removed.

Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"There were six bids initially submitted for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo was ultimately elected as the host city at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.",41
Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics,Bidding process,"The Olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city's application to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by its National Olympic Committee (NOC) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the IOC during an ordinary session. The process is governed by the Olympic Charter, as stated in Chapter 5, Rule 34.Since 1999, the process has consisted of two phases. During the first phase, which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline, the ""applicant cities"" are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organization. This information allows the IOC to analyze the cities' hosting capacities and the strengths and weaknesses of their plans. Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports, the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is the true candidature stage: the accepted applicant cities (from now on referred to as ""candidate cities"") are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended, more detailed, candidature file. These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a group composed of IOC members, representatives of international sport federations, NOCs, athletes, the International Paralympic Committee, and international experts in various fields. It is chaired by Sir Craig Reedie. The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four-day inspection visits to each of the candidate cities, where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of the themes covered in the candidature file. The Evaluation Commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the IOC members up to one month before the electing IOC Session.The IOC Session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the Olympics. The election is made by the assembled active IOC members (excluding honorary and honor members), each possessing one vote. Members from countries that have a city taking part in the election cannot vote while the city is in the running. The voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an absolute majority of votes; if this does not happen in the first round, the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins. In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes, a special runoff vote is carried out, with the winner proceeding to the next round. After each round, the eliminated bid is announced. Following the announcement of the host city, the successful bid delegation signs the ""Host City Contract"" with the IOC, which delegates the responsibilities of the Games organisation to the city and respective NOC.",533

Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics,Proposed bids which did not go to application,"The following cities had proposed bidding; however, they did not bid or even formally announce their intentions to bid. Those cities that won the bid for the next Olympics do include: Brisbane, Australia, had bid for 2020 Summer Olympics but it was too late to consider. Instead, it bid for the future Olympics, but so far it has been selected to host the 2032 Summer Olympics. However, Paris, France, was eventually selected to host the 2024 Olympic Games, as France pulled out of the 2020 bid following the defeat of Annecy's bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. 2024 will coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 1924 Olympics which were held in the French capital. Various cities in the United States were interested in bidding, but the USOC confirmed that the US would not bid, citing an ongoing dispute with the IOC. The IOC stated that it would like to have received a bid for 2020 from the United States. On 29 August 2011, it was revealed that Las Vegas submitted a bid to the IOC without USOC consent. The IOC rejected the bid. Nearby Los Angeles in California had won the 2028 Summer Olympics.In Germany, Berlin, after it had hosted the cancelled Olympics due to World War I in 1916, then another one in 1936, it had failed the bidding in 2000 and 2020. Budapest also bid for both 1916, 1920, 1936, 1944, 1960, 2020 and 2028; but in the end it was not selected.Kuala Lumpur had started to bid for 2008 Summer Olympics, but it was not selected in 2001. Then, Kuala Lumpur decided to bid for the future Olympics in view of the increasing public transport connectivity with the Mass Rapid Transit that is opened in 2017. With the change of governments since 2018, it has been plagued with cancellation of high-speed rail and the rising cases in Malaysia. Instead, it was the city where the IOC selects the city for 2022 Winter Olympics, and also had not been selected for 2024, 2028 and 2032 Summer Olympics. At India, where the first SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant had originated, Delhi, had the intention to bid for the Olympics, in the end it was not successful. Cairo (Egypt), Casablanca (Morocco), Durban (South Africa) and Nairobi (Kenya) had also bid for the Olympics in Africa, which will be the first African city to host if selected. It was announced on 17 August 2011, that South Africa will not put forth a 2020 bid. Otherwise, in Dubai (UAE), it was considering a bid for 2020 Summer Olympics but decided to wait until 2024, while the fact is that in the Arab continent, it was the first to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup at Qatar. In the North America, Guadalajara was not selected and Toronto had long considered a bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics, especially after their successful bid for the 2015 Pan American Games, but announced on 11 August 2011 that the idea will be dropped due to budgetary restrictions. In Europe, Lisbon has been the first time bidding in the Olympics, but in Russia, St Petersburg decided not to bid despite having discussed the plan with the head of the Russian Olympic Committee. They withdrew on 22 August 2011, instead planning on bidding for either 2024 or 2028. Prague was cancelled due to the previous global financial crisis and the H1N1.

Weightlifting at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Qualification,Qualification system,"For each weight class, 14 weightlifters qualify. These places are allocated as follows:
Eight from the IWF ranking list.
Five continental places from that ranking list, with one per continent limited to NOCs without other qualified athletes.
One from either the host nation (six weight classes) or Tripartite Commission invitation (eight weight classes).An NOC could only qualify one athlete per weight class, and four per sex across all weight classes.
The maximum number of athletes per NOC across all weight classes could also be limited due to anti-doping violations: if any NOC had between 10 and 19 violations from the 2008 Summer Olympics period through the end of 2020 qualifying, it was limited to two men and two women. If any NOC had 20 or more violations, it was limited to one man and one woman.Furthermore, six nations are currently suspended by the IWF for multiple doping offenses, and thus are barred outright from the 2020 Games. Four of these suspensions have been confirmed, while two are part of ongoing appeal proceedings.Below are a list of nations with restricted numbers as a result of high levels of historic doping offences.Excluded outright from 2020 Summer Olympics:

 Egypt
 Malaysia
 Romania
 ThailandRestricted to one male and one female lifter for 20 or more violations:

Restricted to two male and one female lifters for 20 or more violations:

Restricted to two male and two female lifters for between 10 and 19 violations:

Also forfeited places: 
 Brazil: forfeited one place due to positive doping test.Places earned by the ranking list (including continental places) or Tripartite Commission were awarded to the specific athlete by name. Places for the host nation were awarded to the NOC, which could allocate them among the various weight classes. If Japanese weightlifters qualified through the ranking list, the number of host nation places would decrease (that is, the host places would only be used if Japan qualified fewer than three men and three women, and only so many as needed to bring Japan up to those numbers would be used). Unused host places would be awarded through the world ranking list.Ranking points could be earned at various weightlifting events with a multiplier based on the level of event (gold events had a 1.1 multiplier, silver 1.05, and bronze 1.0). The best results in each of the three periods were considered (1 November 2018 – 30 April 2019; 1 May 2019 – 31 October 2019; 1 November 2019 – 31 May 2021), along with the overall best result. To qualify, the weightlifter must have competed in at least one event in each of the three periods, have competed in at least six events overall, and have competed in at least one gold-level event and one other gold- or silver-level event. These restrictions were loosened for athletes using host nation quota places (who needed only one event in each period and one gold- or silver-level event) and Tripartite Commission invitation places (two events overall, including at least one gold- or silver-level).With all sporting competitions postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee approved the IWF's decision to extend its qualifying program by a year. Hence, the third phase, severely affected by the pandemic, would be split into two distinct periods with an interval between 30 April and 30 September 2020. Scores attained during the interval would not be counted towards the IWF Absolute World and Continental Rankings, respectively.Eligible ranking events were:
