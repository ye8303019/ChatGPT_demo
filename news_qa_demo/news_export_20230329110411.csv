2ddec18b-c641-3755-81ef-b51dc087c040,Rate of Kids Hospitalized in Mental Health Crisis Keeps Rising,"TUESDAY, March 28, 2023 -- Children with mental health problems are flooding America's hospitals.
A new study of 4.8 million pediatric hospitalizations between 2009 and 2019 found that the number of acute care hospitalizations for kids with mental health problems increased significantly. In 2019, most were due to attempted suicides, suicidal thoughts or self-injury, researchers said.
""What we’re seeing are more and more hospital stays by children and adolescents due to mental health concerns in terms of absolute numbers, and a substantially larger fraction of these stays are related to suicide or self-injury,"" said study leader
Mary Arakelyan
, research project manager at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.
""With hospitalizations for mental health concerns representing a larger proportion of all pediatric hospitalizations in 2019 than in 2009, it’s imperative to consider how inpatient settings will meet the mental health needs of a growing population of young people,"" she added.
The study found that pediatric mental health hospitalizations rose 26% between 2009 and 2019.
And, over that same period, those owing to attempted suicide, suicidal thought or self-injury increased from 31% to 64%.
Senior researcher
Dr. JoAnna Leyenaar
, vice chair of research in the pediatric department at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, said kids with mental health issues go to hospitals because they have nowhere else to turn.
""Acute care hospitals provide access to care for youth and families when they’re experiencing a mental health crisis and aren’t sure where else to turn, when they need medical care for a suicide attempt or self-injury, and when they’re concerned that they’re not safe at home,"" she said.
The hospitalizations are a marker of the increasing prevalence and severity of mental health conditions in kids, Leyenaar said.
The surge likely owes to many factors, she said.
""We know that there’s a national shortage of mental health professionals and geographic disparities in mental health professionals who care for children,"" Leyenaar said. ""As a result, community-based treatment is often hard to access."" In many places, patients must travel a great distance to access care.
Meanwhile, the prevalence of mental health conditions in youth has continued to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said.
In addition, there are several risk factors for mental health crises, and many have been on the rise over the past decade. These include social media, poor sleep, and peer and family conflict, Leyenaar said.
A lack of community and school resources are also contributors, Arakelyan said.
""It’s likely that while other causes of hospitalization in children are becoming less common due to improved outpatient management, outpatient and community and school-based resources for mental health have not kept pace with needs,"" she said.
Leyenaar said it's important for parents to know that asking their children about suicide and thoughts of self-harm does not increase suicide risk.
""It may be protective, allowing families to seek support before a crisis occurs. Reducing stigma in talking about mental health conditions is also important,"" she said. ""Mental health symptoms are common in adolescents, and being open to talking about them and seeking treatment early may be really helpful for some youth.""
The study was published March 28 in the
Journal of the American Medical Association
.
A New York mental health expert agreed that there is a shortage of providers and lack of outpatient services to help kids who have emotional problems.
Dr. Scott Krakower
sees the result of that in his practice as an attending pediatric psychiatrist at Northwell Health in Glen Oaks, N.Y.
""We are swamped in our outpatient services,"" he said. ""We try our best but there are no other mental health providers to tackle outpatient needs.""
Moreover, there aren't enough mental health care providers to help children before or after a crisis, Krakower said. And most insurance doesn't cover the long-term care these young people need.
""Insurances have gotten tighter about what they will cover,"" Krakower said. ""Given everything that's happening, and because nobody wants to see people struggling with this, insurance coverage has been a big barrier.""
If earlier diagnosis and treatment were more readily available, many of these hospitalizations could be avoided, he said.
As it is, a young person may have to wait up to six months for an outpatient appointment because of a shortage of providers, Krakower said. The lack of outpatient care is often why children and teens aren't treated for depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts until a crisis occurs, and going to an emergency room is the only option, he said.

1f6239b4-0099-3ce5-8298-86edad16b206,AHA News: Irregular Sleep Schedule Linked to High Blood Pressure,"TUESDAY, March 28, 2023 (American Heart Association News) -- People with irregular sleep patterns may face substantially higher odds of high blood pressure than those who stick to a schedule, even when they get the recommended amount of sleep each night, new research suggests.
The study, published Tuesday in the journal Hypertension, found people who slept in on the weekends or varied the times they went to sleep and woke up throughout the week were substantially more likely to have high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, than those with more consistent sleep routines.
""This indicates that people may need to consider not only how long they sleep, but also recognize the importance of keeping a regular sleep schedule for optimal cardiovascular health,"" said senior study author Danny Eckert, director of the Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health and a professor in the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia.
The American Heart Association recommends adults get seven to nine hours of nightly sleep to promote optimal heart and brain health. The recommendation is based on prior research that found people who get less than six hours of sleep per night on average face a much higher risk for high blood pressure, obesity, cardiovascular disease and premature death. Likewise, those who get too much sleep – more than an average nine hours per night – face higher risks for high blood pressure, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and death.
The authors of the new study note prior research examining the links between sleep duration, nightly variation in sleep schedules and high blood pressure has relied on data reported over just a few weeks.
In the new study, researchers looked at sleep patterns over a nine-month period for 12,287 adults with and without high blood pressure from 20 countries. Participants were predominantly middle-aged men who were overweight. Data were collected from July 2020 to March 2021. The analysis included an average 181 nights of sleep data and 29 blood pressure readings for each participant.
The study defined high blood pressure as a systolic (top number) reading of 140 mmHg or higher or a diastolic (bottom number) reading of 90 mmHg or above. (The AHA and American College of Cardiology define high blood pressure as a systolic pressure of 130 or higher or a diastolic pressure of 80 or higher that stays high over time.)
The researchers used a device placed under the mattress to measure sleep timing (when people went to sleep and woke up) and duration. They found people whose bedtimes varied by 90 minutes or more faced 92% increased odds for high blood pressure, compared to those who stuck to a regular bedtime. But even those whose bedtimes varied by slightly more than 30 minutes from night to night were 32% more likely to have high blood pressure.
""This is a relatively modest level of sleep timing variability, given that people often stay up late on the weekends,"" Eckert said.
Sleeping late also was associated with higher odds of high blood pressure, but less so than not getting to bed on time. Waking up 43 minutes later was associated with a 9% increase.
As prior studies have found, the new analysis also showed a link between hypertension and getting too little or too much sleep. People who got less than seven or more than nine hours of sleep were 20%-30% more likely to have high blood pressure. People whose sleep duration varied by two hours or more from night to night were 85% more likely to have hypertension than those with less than an hour's difference in the amount of sleep they got each night.
Studying sleep patterns for nine months provides a more stable data set from which to draw conclusions about how sleep may be affecting heart health, said Dr. Reena Mehra, a professor of medicine and director of the Sleep Disorders Research Program at the Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center in Ohio. Mehra was not involved in the new study.
""If you're only looking at a span of weeks, that's a much smaller window of time,"" she said. ""If there's something unusual going on in a person's life, that's going to impact the findings. Whereas if you look at sleep patterns in totality over a span of months, that gives you a better picture of sleep-wake habituality.""
While work schedules and other commitments can sometimes make it hard to keep regular sleep times, the findings confirm the need for people to ""try to be as mindful as possible about sleep,"" Mehra said. ""Do the best you can to get consistency.""

This growth can be attributed to increasing awareness of pet health, increasing pet ownership, and the rising demand for pet health products. Increasing disposable incomes, the rising trend of pet humanization and an increasing number of pet owners are some of the major factors driving the growth of the pet parasiticides market. Furthermore, growing awareness of pet health and increasing awareness of parasitic diseases in pets is also expected to drive the growth of the pet parasiticides market. Additionally, technological advancements in pet parasiticides products, such as spot-on, sprays, and shampoos, are expected to fuel market growth over the near future.

Animal Parasiticides Market
 Scope:
In this report, the animal parasiticides market is segmented on the basis of type, animal type, end user, and region.
""Ectoparasiticides segment accounted for the largest share in the animal parasiticides market.""
The market for animal parasiticides is divided into three distinct classifications based on type such as endoparasiticides, ectoparasiticides, and endectocides. The market for animal parasiticides globally in 2021 was dominated by the ectoparasiticides segment. The high adoption of ectoparasiticides relative to other products accounts for the huge proportion of this market. The rise in pet ownership and the number of companion animals in developed nations are other elements that are anticipated to promote market expansion throughout the projected period.
""Companion Animals segment is expected to witness the fastest growth in the forecast period.""
The market for animal parasiticides is divided into two broad groups like companion animals and livestock animals. The market for animal parasiticides globally was dominated by companion animals in 2021. The significant market share of this sector is largely due to the rising costs of owning pets and the rise in the number of people who own companion animals in developed nations.
""Veterinary Clinics & Hospitals accounted for the largest share of animal parasiticides market in 2020""
The animal parasiticides market is divided into veterinary practices & hospitals, animal farms, and home care settings based on end users. The market for animal parasiticides was dominated in 2021 by veterinary practices and hospitals. The increased use of animal parasiticides in medical settings, the rise in parasitic illnesses, and the rising concern over animal health in developing nations are all factors that contribute to the big proportion of this market.
""North America accounted for the largest share of the animal parasiticides market in 2020""
The animal parasiticides market is divided into five regions based on geography: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. In 2021, North America held the greatest market share for animal parasiticides worldwide. North America has a significant portion of the market because of its strong foundation in the animal health sector, the widespread adoption of companion animals, and the rising costs associated with animal health. During the projected period, the market in Latin America is anticipated to develop at the highest CAGR. This can be ascribed to the rising adoption of pets as well as the expanding populations of livestock animals and consumers of food items generated from animals.

9bd2028b-ccf3-338b-bef0-dee256ebb2f2,Addiction Professionals of North Carolina Supports Faith-Based BIPOC Mental Health Grant,"RALEIGH, N.C., March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Addiction Professionals of North Carolina announces our collaborative partnership with Mount Vernon Christian Church (MVCC) in Clayton, NC to provide mental health awareness and education.
MVCC received a grant from the North Carolina Council of Churches Partners in Health and Wholeness (PHW) to support mental health awareness and education within Black & Brown, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) faith communities. The funding comes through Duke Endowment, which has awarded $10,000 to alleviate the enduring effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had across North Carolina.
Funds will support an educational campaign on mental health, suicide, and substance use prevention. The campaign will include a learning series that teaches churchgoers the necessary steps to access resources while tackling tough conversations surrounding mental health in the community. Each session will build upon knowledge from previous sessions.
MVCC Pastor, Rev. Dr. Terence Leathers, says this grant will help equip his congregation to handle mental health challenges within the church. ""Mental health is something that touches us all at some point,"" he says. ""It's best we learn how to meet these challenges head-on and get to know the agencies in the community that can support us in that.""
APNC's Jarmichael Harris, the Project Lead, states, ""Working with churches in the community will open new roads to reaching the BIPOC Community. We know that faith and spirituality are key to the overall wellbeing of the Black Community, and partnering with churches in Johnston County is a first step in creating healing as we address social determinants of health and other factors to improve wellness outcomes.""
Programming will occur at or around the MVCC campus and feature selected staff members of APNC and community agencies across Johnston County. Workshops will be advertised and marketed with other BIPOC churches in the area. The program will run through December 2023.
Addiction Professionals of North Carolina (APNC) is a professional association that shapes a healthier North Carolina through advocacy, professional development, and technical assistance. APNC helps those on the front lines of the substance use disorder services field to provide the best possible services. APNC connects addiction professionals, organizations, coalitions, corporations, and communities to encourage collaboration and innovative solutions to the addiction and overdose epidemic.

ARLINGTON, Va., March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Council on Aging (NCOA), the national voice for every person's right to age well, announces its 2023 Boost Your Budget Week campaign, held April 10 to 14. Throughout the week, community organizations across the country will help older adults enroll in federal, state, and local benefits programs that can help bridge the widening gap between their income and the basic costs of living.
Continue Reading
Now more than ever, these efforts are vital. According to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data, adults age 65 and over are the only age group to have experienced increasing rates of poverty: up from 8.9% in 2020 to 10.3% in 2021. And the results are sobering: today, 1 million more older adults lack sufficient resources to make ends meet.
Boost Your Budget Week is one tool that can help struggling older adults defray their high costs of living. - Ramsey Alwin
Tweet this
""We now have almost 6 million older adults who cannot age with dignity,"" said Ramsey Alwin, NCOA's President and CEO. ""This is a clear indication that our nation's support programs are not meeting today's realities. Boost Your Budget Week is one tool that can help struggling older adults defray their high costs of living.""
New research bears this out. UMass Boston's Elder Index, which measures the minimum income for covering basic living expenses for older adults, shows that a single adult renter age 65 or over in the United States needs an average of $2,410 per month to pay housing, health care, food, and transportation costs. Compared to the average monthly Social Security benefit of just under $1,700, the math simply does not add up.
Older adults and their caregivers can use NCOA's free, confidential online tool available in both English and Spanish—BenefitsCheckUp.org and BuscaBeneficios.org—to see what benefits they might be eligible for depending on their zip code. They enter basic information and receive a personalized report of programs that can help them pay for food, medicine, utilities, and other daily needs. Individuals who have additional questions and need assistance in applying for benefits can call a toll-free helpline, 1-800-794-6559, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. EST.
Dozens of organizations nationwide implement the Boost Your Budget campaign in rural and urban communities serving Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and LGBTQ+ older adults with limited incomes. These local agencies are part of NCOA's national network of Benefits Enrollment Centers, funded through the U.S. Administration for Community Living (ACL).
""Older adults leave $30 billion in benefits on the table every year because they don't apply for those programs. That extra money can make a huge difference for their financial security,"" said Josh Hodges, NCOA's Chief Customer Officer.
This project is supported, in part, by grant #90MINC0002-02-02 from the U.S. Administration on Community Living (ACL), Department of Health and Human Services. Points of view or opinions do not, therefore, necessarily represent official Administration for Community Living policy.

Working with thousands of national and local partners, we provide resources, tools, best practices, and advocacy to ensure every person can age with health and financial security.

68f3d9f4-e85d-340e-9342-49953f32e934,MedCrypt Joins Microsoft Azure Marketplace Offering One of the Only Cryptography Tools with an API Specifically Designed for Medical Devices,"Azure customers worldwide now have access to MedCrypt's cryptography API solution, Guardian, which allows manufacturers to build cryptography directly into medical devices
SAN DIEGO, March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- MedCrypt, Inc., the proactive cybersecurity solution provider for medical device manufacturers, today announced it was selected to participate in Microsoft Azure for Startups, a global program dedicated to accelerating the trajectory of startups through access to a network of technology, mentorship, and business support. As part of its participation, MedCrypt has also announced the launch of its product, Guardian, an embedded library that makes it easy to build cryptography, validate integrity, and keep data private, on the Azure Marketplace.
""We're excited to join the Microsoft Azure Marketplace ecosystem as it is a great avenue for startups to discover technologies and platforms that enable secure innovation,"" said Mike Kijewski, CEO of MedCrypt. ""The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires manufacturers to include security features into their devices and our collaboration with Microsoft is now making Guardian available to its medical device manufacturing customers, bringing cybersecurity closer to these devices.""
As administrators and operators of medical devices, hospitals must comply with certain Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security and privacy requirements. Additionally, FDA guidelines also mandate devices to be secured to ensure safety. Both of these conditions can be met by using encryption. Integrating connected medical devices across healthcare poses cybersecurity risks. In response, the FDA released updates to its premarket cybersecurity guidance and postmarket cybersecurity guidance, which establish expectations related to the design and maintenance of medical devices.
This collaboration announcement will provide medical device manufacturers with a seamless experience in implementing cryptography in support of those requirements while also furthering MedCrypt's reach to Microsoft's existing customer base. With streamlined deployment and management, customers can now take advantage of the scalability and security provided by Azure. MedCrypt's Guardian meets the needs of software-enabled and connected medical devices with an opportunity to adopt improved security tooling and provides device manufacturers a helpful starting point when building with the Azure Marketplace.
""We are thrilled to be added to the Microsoft Azure platform, as it'll help medical device manufacturers adopt and deploy our services more easily, which directly impacts how secure their devices will be,"" said Vidya Murphy, chief operating officer at MedCrypt. ""Launching on the Azure Marketplace is the next step in enabling more medical device companies to drastically improve their security programs, which is incredibly important given that 53% of connected medical devices and other internet of things (IoT) devices in hospitals were found to have known critical vulnerabilities.""
""Customers around the globe are using Microsoft Azure and we are glad to see a partner like MedCrypt deliver a Cryptography API tool to help manufacturers optimize security on medical devices,"" said Sally Frank, worldwide lead for health and life sciences, Microsoft for Startups. ""Medical device manufacturers are switching to Azure for product support and having Guardian, MedCrypt's Cryptography API tool fits a need for the marketplace.""
MedCrypt currently provides enhanced security products and services for seven of the top 10 medical device manufacturers and startups and mid-sized companies, including the leading manufacturers of surgical robotics technologies and virtual reality applications for minimally invasive surgery.
In early November 2022, MedCrypt announced a $25M Series B funding round, followed by additional investment from Dexcom Ventures in January 2023. The company will use these funds to scale its cryptography, behavior monitoring, and vulnerability management products across various medical devices, such as glucose monitors and other diabetes devices. For more information about MedCrypt and its suite of security solutions, please visit medcrypt.com.

WASHINGTON, March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) today announced funding awards totaling $123 million to support 15 new research studies. These studies aim to fill evidence gaps, enhance research methods, or improve health care decision making for a range of high-burden concerns among adults and children, including postpartum complications occurring in populations experiencing the greatest disparities in health outcomes.
In addition, PCORI awarded $4 million for two implementation projects intended to accelerate uptake of strategies shown in PCORI-funded studies, one to improve decision making about colorectal cancer screening as well as one to improve outcomes for patients with asthma.
""These latest awards demonstrate PCORI's commitment to funding important research addressing evidence gaps on key health issues identified through the ongoing input and guidance of patients and stakeholders, including the persistent and worsening maternal health crisis that is a priority for PCORI,"" said PCORI Executive Director Nakela L. Cook, M.D., MPH. ""The research awards announced today will provide sound evidence to help patients and those who care for them make sense of their many options in a complex health care environment. This research also will contribute data and strategies to help achieve health equity, one of PCORI's National Priorities for Health.""
View all the newly funded studies and projects.                                                           
New CER focuses on postpartum care, hypertension management  
Six of the newly approved comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER) studies were awarded through targeted PCORI funding opportunities on specific high-priority topics identified and shaped through input from patients and other stakeholders. These include:
Four studies comparing multicomponent strategies to improve postpartum care and outcomes for groups most often underserved or experiencing the greatest health disparities, such as Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, rural and low-income populations.
Two studies comparing the effectiveness of approaches to remote blood pressure monitoring that aim to address inequities in blood pressure control, including screenings through community-based organizations and remote monitoring via cell phones.
Other CER studies approved for PCORI funding include:
A study comparing two interventions shown to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for ear infections in children.
A study comparing three strategies, preoperative prehabilitation, postoperative rehabilitation and a combined approach for patients needing stenting for peripheral artery disease.
A third study assessing approaches to improve shared decision making and access to non-dialytic treatment for patients with advanced kidney disease.
Another comparing approaches to screening for hearing loss among preschool-age children.
A fifth assessing ways to increase guideline-recommended health surveillance for children and adults with neurofibromatosis.
In addition, PCORI approved four studies that aim to improve methods for conducting patient-centered CER to ensure this burgeoning field of research generates reliable, trustworthy results. Areas of focus include machine learning, more efficient use of electronic medical records for research, improving trial design and analysis, and the function of secure messaging in health care.
Promoting the uptake of PCORI-funded research into practice
Two newly approved projects are focused on implementing findings of past PCORI-funded research, advancing the organization's efforts to pursue and refine ways to support uptake of useful evidence in a variety of care settings where it can improve people's outcomes.
One project will work with two health systems to make an online decision aid about colorectal cancer screening available to patients due for screening. The other project will work with four diverse medical systems to implement a new, patient-activated approach for patients with moderate to severe asthma to improve symptom control, reduce exacerbations and reduce missed days of work or school.
""PCORI funds projects to promote the adoption of useful findings from comparative clinical effectiveness research. These projects help to ensure that research evidence is implemented in clinical practice and has the opportunity to have a salutary impact on patients, clinicians and health systems,"" said Harv Feldman, M.D., PCORI's Deputy Executive Editor for Patient-Centered Research Programs. ""Many patients who confront important decisions about health screenings and care for themselves or loved ones with a chronic condition may experience better care and outcomes as a result of PCORI's latest implementation funding awards.""
Details of all studies and projects approved for funding to date are available on PCORI's website. All funding awards were approved pending a business and programmatic review by PCORI staff and the issuance of formal award contracts. With these latest awards, PCORI has invested approximately $4 billion to fund patient-centered CER and other research-related projects.

1f2a2749-78ad-3e85-bcf9-a4c36818e23c,PANTHERx® Rare Launches Drug for APDS,"PITTSBURGH, March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- PANTHERx® Rare, one of the largest and fastest growing rare pharmacies in the United States, is pleased to announce the launch of Joenja® (leniolisib), an oral selective small-molecule PI3K delta inhibitor indicated for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients ages 12 or older.
""Our patients living with rare and devastating diseases deserve the best that medicine can offer. Through innovation and technology, we continue to make a positive impact on the quality of life of those living with rare diseases. We are pleased to add Joenja® to the list of medications in PANTHERx® portfolio
,"" said Rob Snyder, president of PANTHERx® Rare.
Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase-Delta Syndrome, or APDS, is a rare primary immunodeficiency affecting approximately one to two people per million with disease onset occurring as early as infancy. This condition results from a variant in the genes PIK3CD or PIK3R1 with both genes playing a role in the regulation of white blood cell maturation. The presence of a mutation in these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ pathway resulting in a failure for the immune cells (B and T cells) to mature and properly function. Imbalance in the PI3Kδ pathway results in immunodeficiency and dysregulation. Those with APDS may develop recurrent respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, lymphoproliferation as well as neurodevelopment delay and failure to thrive. Clinical presentation is highly variable ranging from asymptomatic adults to those suffering from lymphoproliferation or development of profound immunodeficiency.
Snyder explained Joenja® exerts its effects by blocking the active binding sites of PI3Kδ inhibiting the signaling pathway hyperactivity that leads to dysfunction and dysregulation of B and T cells. In clinical trials, Joenja® achieved both co-primary efficacy measures of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. The most common adverse reactions (>10%) were headache, sinusitis, and atrophic dermatitis.
About PANTHERx Rare
PANTHERx Rare is one of the largest and fastest growing rare pharmacies in the United States. PANTHERx transforms lives by delivering medicine breakthroughs, clinical excellence, and access solutions to people living with rare and devastating conditions. Although the overall incidence of rare diseases is as common as diabetes, less than 7% of the 7,000 known rare and devastating disorders have an FDA-approved therapy. Changes in federal policy and advances in science have led to a surge in FDA orphan drug approvals, providing tremendous hope to the rare disease community.
PANTHERx was recently awarded Specialty Pharmacy of the Year by the National Association of Specialty Pharmacy (NASP) and earned the inaugural Accredited Distinction in Rare Diseases and Orphan Drugs from the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC). PANTHERx is now a five-time winner of the prestigious MMIT Patient Choice Award, including the 2022 honor. PANTHERx is headquartered in Pittsburgh, licensed in all 50 states, and holds accreditations from URAC, NABP, and ACHC.

77ec6525-4735-3b1a-a68c-fefce8127936,CathVision Announces Key Milestones in Advance of ECGenius Commercial Launch,"ECGenius System & CARDIALYTICS Suite Recognized as Critical to the Evolution of Electrophysiology 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- CathVision, a medical technology company developing innovative electrophysiology solutions designed to enhance clinical decision-making in the EP lab, is proud to announce the achievement of significant milestones demonstrating both the clinical and commercial success of the ECGenius™ System.1 The ECGenius System is an innovative EP recording technology that includes a proprietary hardware amplifier allowing electrophysiologists to acquire high-fidelity, low-noise cardiac electrograms to improve the diagnosis and treatment of complex atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF).
Continue Reading
In recent months, CathVision has achieved several key milestones:
World-renowned hospitals have repeatedly utilized the ECGenius System during the current limited market release.
Tweet this
Physician Validation & Confirmed Market Opportunity: Since receiving FDA clearance in May of 2022, several world-renowned hospitals, including Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, IU Health Methodist Hospital, NYU Langone Health, and Valley Health, have repeatedly utilized the ECGenius System during the current limited market release. Leading electrophysiologists at these hospitals have recognized ECGenius' ability to provide clear signal data that helps clinicians identify, diagnose, and treat complex cardiac arrhythmias. As a result, in many EP labs, the ECGenius System has replaced existing EP recording systems, including LabSystem Pro and CardioLab, as the primary EP system for measuring, analyzing, recording, and routing pacing.
Clinical Progress: In the past 18 months, three clinical studies have completed the evaluation of the ECGenius System and CARDIALYTICS™ suite of artificial intelligence-powered analytics using RF, cryo, and pulsed-field ablation technologies at AZ Sint-Jan Brugge-Oostende, UZ Gent, UZ Brussels, Clinique Pasteur Toulouse, University of Vermont Medical Center, and Rigshospitalet (National Hospital of Denmark).2 Additionally, two clinical studies, with patients enrolled at the prestigious institution of NYU Langone Health in New York and OLV Hospital Aalst in Belgium, aim to validate the clinical utility of automated electrogram analyses using high-quality signal data to analyze ablation therapy progress using the Signal Complexity™ module when treating patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.
Strengthened Intellectual Property (IP) Portfolio: CathVision's core IP is centered on both low-noise inventions (ECGenius System) and algorithm innovation (CARDIALYTICS). The Company's technologies are covered by 13 patent families, of which six are granted and seven are pending.
Scientific Recognition: CathVision's ECGenius System and CARDIALYTICS' AI-based analytics have received industry recognition with seven scientific abstracts featuring the technology accepted for presentation at the upcoming Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) conference in New Orleans. This attention further solidifies ECGenius System's place as an exciting technology that will advance the field of electrophysiology.
""It's rewarding and validating to see our ECGenius System and CARDIALYTICS suite making such a positive impact in the electrophysiology field,"" said Mads Matthiesen, CEO of CathVision. ""Our team has invested many years of research and development to create a solution to a challenge that many EPs didn't previously recognize because innovation in EP recording technology has been lacking for so long. By introducing high-quality, low-noise signal data, Electrophysiologists can more clearly see the complexity of every heartbeat, which gives them the potential to vastly improve patient treatment. The recognition and adoption of the ECGenius System demonstrates the importance of our advanced technology and the critical need to evolve EP recording.""
The ECGenius System is commercially available in the United States in limited market release. For more information about the ECGenius System, please visit the CathVision website or email [email protected].
About CathVision
CathVision is a medical technology company that develops electrophysiology solutions centered around an innovative EP recording system and AI algorithm platform – the ECGenius System.

One of the nation's largest psychiatry practices continues to expand talent base, geographic footprint, and in-network insurance coverage
NEW YORK, March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Talkiatry, a leading provider of high-quality, in-network psychiatric care and one of the largest employers of psychiatrists in the United States, has added Dr. Allison Holt as Medical Director and Todd Yu as Chief Financial Officer. The two join Talkiatry as it continues to expand access to psychiatric care across the nation.
With an ongoing national mental health crisis and psychiatrist shortage, millions of Americans are struggling to access mental health care. Roadblocks include health insurance and affordability issues, long wait times for an initial appointment, and cultural and societal stigma. Roughly 45% of psychiatrists do not accept insurance and a much larger percentage accept a very limited set of plans, which leaves many patients to pay for hefty out-of-pocket cash visits or opt not to receive help because it is a financial burden.
Talkiatry is a national mental health practice addressing many of the accessibility issues that have blighted the mental health care ecosystem. Providing virtual psychiatry and therapy covered by more than 60 health insurance plans nationwide, Talkiatry's team of more than 300 psychiatrists specializes in conditions ranging from anxiety to depression to PTSD. New patients can be seen within days of making an appointment, have 60-minute first visits and 30-minute follow-ups, and see the same psychiatrist every time.
""Talkiatry strives to provide the best possible psychiatric care by extending accessibility and increasing affordability for our patients,"" said Robert Krayn, CEO and cofounder of Talkiatry. ""With Dr. Holt and Todd Yu in the fold, we add two highly capable experts who will improve our care delivery while we grow to meet the mental health needs of more and more people across the country.""
Dr. Allison Holt is double-board-certified in child and adolescent psychiatry and adult psychiatry and has 15 years of experience in various settings including health care administration, academia, managed care, hospital acute care, and private practice outpatient care. She is responsible for stewarding Talkiatry's outpatient psychiatric practice model by providing clinical leadership, clinician engagement, mentoring, and quality of care for a team of Chief Psychiatrists.
Dr. Holt was most recently the Physician Chief of the Mental Health and Addiction Service Line at M Health Fairview, the largest provider of mental health care in Minnesota. Concurrently, she was the Vice Chair of Clinical Affairs at the University of Minnesota Department of Psychiatry where she developed effective and collaborative relationships with the department chair and executive leadership team. As the physician chief of the Mental Health and Addiction Service line, the Minneapolis-St. Paul Magazine ""Top Doctor"" oversaw 340+ acute care hospital beds, 30+ residential dual diagnosis beds, and 150+ psychiatric providers.
""Every doctor dreams of having a positive, life-changing impact on as many lives as possible, and with Talkiatry's nationwide reach, I now join an amazing team who's doing just that,"" said Dr. Holt. ""The well-being of our patients will always be my main priority, and with my new role at Talkiatry I'm thrilled to help lead our psychiatrists in reaching more people with the empathetic mental health support they need."" 
As Talkiatry's Chief Financial Officer, Todd Yu brings two decades of financial management and strategic planning leadership experience in the healthcare and finance industries. Todd will be an integral leader responsible for driving Talkiatry's growth and strategy execution. Todd most recently served as Chief Financial Officer for Upward Health, a high-growth, risk-bearing, home-based medical group. Prior to that, he was the VP of Finance at The Gersh Organization, an educational institute for students on the autism spectrum.
""With Talkiatry's psychiatrists on the front lines fighting the mental health crisis, I jumped at the chance to contribute to the company's overall strategy and mission by implementing value-based care,"" said Mr. Yu. "". I've always had a passion for helping the most vulnerable people among us, and Talkiatry allows me to apply these values in the real world by reaching millions of people who are suffering and need mental health care.""
""We've been laying down a strong foundation of value-based care at Talkiatry, which is the future of behavioral health,"" said Dr. Georgia Gaveras, co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of Talkiatry. ""Dr. Holt's clinical expertise coupled with Todd's financial experience at value-based healthcare organizations strengthens our operations and brings us another step closer to making the mental health care we strive for a reality.""
About Talkiatry
Talkiatry is a national mental health practice that provides in-network psychiatry and therapy. They were co-founded by a patient and a triple-board-certified psychiatrist to solve the problems both groups face in accessing and providing the highest quality mental healthcare. 60% of adults in the U.S. with a diagnosable mental illness go untreated every year because care is inaccessible, while 45% of clinicians are out of network with insurers because reimbursement rates are low and paperwork is unduly burdensome. With innovative technology and a human-centered philosophy, Talkiatry provides patients with the care they need—and allows psychiatrists to focus on why they got into medicine.

The Phase III clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-regional study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5mg (0.5% concentration) twice daily (BID) KX-826 for treating male AGA adults in China. Professor Zhang Jianzhong from Peking University People's Hospital and Professor Yang Qinping from Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University are the leading principal investigators (leading PIs) of this trial. The primary endpoint for the clinical trial is the change from baseline in non-vellus target area hair counts (TAHC) after 24 weeks of treatment in comparison to placebo. The safety endpoints mainly include the type, incidence and severity of adverse events.
On 8 September 2021, the company announced that the primary endpoint of Phase II clinical trial of KX-826 for male AGA adults in China was met. After 24 weeks of treatment, the TAHC in the 5mg (0.5% concentration) BID KX-826 group increased by 15.34/cm2 compared with the placebo group from baseline, with a statistical difference (P=0.024). On 1 December 2022, the company announced that the primary endpoint of Phase II clinical trial of KX-826 for female AGA adults in China was met. After 24 weeks of treatment, the TAHC in the 5 mg (0.5% concentration) once daily (QD) KX-826 group increased by 11.39/cm2 compared with the placebo group from baseline, with a statistical difference (P=0.0087). KX-826 has showed a good safety profile in both trials. In addition, the Phase II clinical trial of KX-826 for the treatment of male AGA adults in the US has completed the enrollment of all subjects in August 2022, and the company expects to release the top-line data in the second quarter of 2023.
Dr. Youzhi Tong, founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kintor Pharma, commented, ""We would like to thank all the PIs from 26 centers and the company's medical and clinical operations staff for their joint efforts to finish the subjects enrollment under the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic. This is another important milestone we have achieved following that the Phase II trials of KX-826 for male and female AGA in China have reached the primary endpoints, respectively. The company will continue to move forward the execution of 24-week study plus 4-week safety follow-up assessment with high quality, and expect to release the top-line data in Q4 2023. If the data is positive, we would proceed with the NDA application with the China NMPA. Meanwhile, the company is planning for KX-826's MRCT studies and actively pursuing licensing-out opportunities. We believe that KX-826 would benefit hair loss people around the globe.""
About Androgenetic alopecia
Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), caused by excessive secretion of androgens, is the most common type of hair loss, accounting for about 90% of overall hair loss. It is estimated that one in four male adults and one in twenty female adults suffer from hair loss. The existing treatment drugs are limited, and the majority of people with hair loss urgently need more safe and effective innovative drugs to address the hair loss trouble.
About KX-826
KX-826 is an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist and a potential first-in-class topical drug for the treatment of AGA and acne vulgaris. For the AGA indication, on 8 September 2021, Kintor Pharma announced that the primary endpoint of the Phase II clinical trial of KX-826 on male adults was met, with results demonstrating a positive efficacy and safety profile. On 1 December 2022, Kintor Pharma announced that the primary endpoint of Phase II clinical trial of KX-826 for female AGA adults in China was met. Kintor Pharma has completed the enrollment of all subjects in its Phase III clinical trial of KX-826 in China and Phase II clinical trial of KX-826 in the US for male AGA adults. For the acne vulgaris indication, Kintor Pharma has completed the enrollment of subjects in its Phase II clinical trial of KX-826 in China.

aa3f9cfe-32ad-3d28-a227-10842efd2ed0,Healthcare Revolution: Medical Tourism and the American Dream,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla., March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The 15th annual Healthcare Revolution (May 23, 2023), the largest confluence of thought leaders in the world of healthcare, self-funded employers, brokers, and healthcare leaders, has launched, and this time with thought-provoking and insightful discussions about how self-funded employers can leverage medical tourism to achieve great healthcare outcomes for their employees at a fraction of their current healthcare spend.
This year's Healthcare Revolution is about the failings of the American Dream with rising and unsustainable healthcare costs, and how employers can navigate the unending opportunities of medical travel.
U.S. healthcare for Americans has now become a luxury and far from the reach of many. In the past the majority of bad debt from healthcare was from the uninsured. Now, in America 58% of bad debt comes from healthcare expenses from people covered by insurance but unable to pay their deductibles, co-insurance and out of pocket expenses. The 2022 Kaiser Family Foundation's Health Care Debt Survey found that eight of 10 adults had health care debt and 5 in 10 of adults without health care debt reported skipping or delaying treatment due to cost in the prior 12 months.
Employers and employees alike are struggling to pay for healthcare. 
Annual premiums for employer-sponsored family coverage, according to 2022 Employer Health Benefits Survey by KFF, has reached $22,463, with workers paying $6,106 of this and employers paying the rest. This is up by more than 40 percent since 2012, when annual premium for employer-sponsored family health coverage was £16,351.
But with inflation eating away at employee earnings, healthcare costs have become too expensive for most American households, with many skipping prescriptions and treatments, or avoiding medical care altogether to prevent running into financial debt.
With these distressing data getting worse with each month, self-funded employers have to take the reins and determine how to shift their healthcare spending for optimal outcomes. This years' conference is the game changer for health payers lost in the sea of America's broken healthcare system and looking for a way to the shore.
The Healthcare Revolution assembles some of the most renowned leaders in self-funded healthcare and well-being.
Learn from self-funded employers who have keyed into medical tourism and pharmacy tourism and scored big time, and how this is leading to huge cost savings running into millions of dollars every year, and improved care outcomes for their employees.
Case studies will be presented by employers who send employees abroad for expensive medical procedures and prescription drugs and whose employees now prefer to receive fast world class healthcare abroad rather than locally.
The employer speakers this year will help break down the barriers and objections that hold back greater adoption of this as an employee benefit. Employers and employee benefits consultants will be given a clear roadmap on how to implement medical travel while providing incentives to employees (waiving deductibles, co-insurance, out of pocket expenses and providing employees thousands in cash, while freeing employees from medical debt, and at a fraction of the U.S. costs.
You will also learn from healthcare leaders from various medical travel destinations, such as Korea, Costa Rica, and Panama, are transforming medical care and advancing the art and science of medicine through ground-breaking innovations.
For the first time, Healthcare Revolution is creating an exclusive audience of the largest network of self-funded employers, employee benefits consultants, insurers, TPAs, and plan sponsors to learn the myriad of opportunities that medical tourism holds.
""Employers and Employees are a breaking point. Nothing is working. It's time to evolve and embrace new solutions like medical tourism"", said Jonathan Edelheit, CEO of Global Healthcare Resources and Medical Tourism Association.
Our array of speakers will break down the constructs around medical travel, educating participants on the propaganda against medical travel destinations, and how the facts state clearly that medical tourism is expanding healthcare and saving costs for U.S. self-funded employers that have keyed into it.

This event is not for employers, insurers, and business leaders that are satisfied with the broken healthcare system in America, or those who enjoy rate increases, spikes in premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for their members; neither is it for business leaders and brokers that are too timid to lead a shift and see concrete changes in their healthcare costs. The event is only for those who are ready to leap forward and take risks through uncharted waters to achieve unrivaled results.

782c2707-e060-3399-8026-3f1d0f46e231,Atropos Health Announces the Atropos Evidence Network and Data Fitness Scoring,"Expanding Opportunities for Reliable Generation and Use of Real-World Evidence in Healthcare
PALO ALTO, Calif., March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Atropos Health, leader in generating personalized real-world evidence at the point and pace of care, today announced the Atropos Evidence™ Network, Real World Data Score™ (RWDS) and Real World Fitness Score (RWFS™). As the latest additions to Atropos Platform, the Atropos Evidence Network and Real World Data & Fitness Scores are designed to offer participants like Mayo Clinic and Stanford Health Care actionable insights - from their EHR and other data sources. It also creates a market for data holders to expand reach of these de-identified assets to a broader audience. What results is an observational insights exchange for healthcare. Atropos Health is the throughline for connection and catalysis of clinical analytics.
The Atropos Evidence Network operates on a federated model, forming secure, cloud-based connections between healthcare data proprietors and clinical insight seekers across the healthcare ecosystem. De-identified data doesn't change hands. Just the insights Atropos generates. A user at an institutional member of the Network, such as a physician or researcher, can pose a clinical question in as little as a sentence or as elaborately as a research protocol. The question can apply to any allowed network member. Within 48 hours, the user receives a novel retrospective observational study in response. It is delivered in the form of a Prognostogram report that contains the figures and analyses needed for peer-reviewed publications - like high dimensional propensity score matching and IPTW. Clinicians with informatics expertise QC each Prognostogram and provide simple summaries of the findings. They are even available for clinical informatics consults to brief requesters on the results.
When it comes to data science and AI applications for clinical Q&A, Atropos Platform is the first and only solution to answer healthcare questions fast, transparently, and with previously unavailable information and data. Observational studies commonly take many months and are burdensome for the parties involved, fraught by gaps and high costs that hinder progress. With Atropos, users are offered a conversational chat interface. Questions can be submitted in a matter of minutes, in a form akin to a short email to a colleague. As is often the case, such frictionless UX is underpinned by sophisticated technology. Atropos Platform boasts a medical data search engine with cohorting capabilities, and an automated analytics pipeline methodologically-reviewed over more than a decade. Standard process yields consistent and transparent results. Lastly, the answers delivered in 48 hours are backed by studies that did not previously exist. Now with Atropos Evidence Network, these studies can be run on multiple datasets at once.
Since studies reproduced on different data often have different outcomes, Atropos crafted Data Scoring solutions to control for the aspects of result variation attributable to artifacts of the source data. All datasets in Atropos Evidence Network receive a confidential Real World Data Score (RWDS), which evaluates overall dataset quality based on key indicators like size, completeness, and longitudinality. This single number per dataset can help a data holder refine their offering, or provide a basic heuristic for users.
The Real World Fitness Score (RWFS) takes the next step of matching the dataset to the incoming question. The score is dynamic, varying for each question submitted. Within Atropos' proprietary algorithm for RWFS generation are suitability indicators such as representation in the datasource of de-identified patient records that meet study IE criteria. As such, when there are differences in Prognostograms run on different datasets, a higher RWFS indicates a more trustworthy result. In other words, the right dataset to use for this study and others like it. Protocol feasibility in just 2 days, with understanding that precedes lengthy downstream meta-analysis.
For Network Members who need the source data, not just the insights, this builds the case for timely and justified data purchases, driving value for the source data providers. It also allows the buyers to invest where their dollar will return the greatest value (data linkage, NLP, curation, enrichment, etc.). Above and beyond delivering novel RWE with rapidity and rigor, Atropos Evidence Network makes a marketplace for efficiency and value in data purchasing.
""This next wave of innovation in our industry has massive potential, but we must unlock greater transactional frequency, lower uncertainty and friction of purchasing, and reach the larger total addressable market of evidence-based medicine at the point of care globally,"" said Brigham Hyde, Ph.D., CEO and Co-Founder of Atropos Health. ""We believe we can be the ally to help our partners and peers to begin to access this new wave of market opportunity and benefit from an acceleration in transactional personalized evidence.""
Atropos Evidence Network already includes an impressive slate of leaders in the healthcare data ecosystem, including CancerLinq, Clarify Health, Healthjump, OMNY Health, and Syntegra. The company is proud to be a clinical insights partner for these innovative institutions, spanning hundreds of millions of de-identified patient records nationwide. Together, we intend to usher in the next wave of medicine, with technologically- advanced, secure, and ethical approaches to learning from healthcare data. Augmenting clinicians and researchers in this way creates workflow efficiencies in the information-foraging pathway and can reduce operational and healthcare costs. Most importantly - evidence based medicine improves patient care. The Network orients around this central goal.
This announcement comes on the heels of recent news of the appointment of Atropos Clinical Advisory Board, a collective of healthcare industry experts across AMCs, healthcare organizations, and private institutions who believe in the power of this Platform. They will extend Atropos' track record of delivering the ROI of evidence in action, as seen at Stanford Health Care.
Atropos Health originated from an idea at Stanford Health Care in 2011, where doctors envisioned a future when learning from the EHR would be as easy as pressing a ""green button."" Today Atropos exceeds the charge with Prognostograms across Network of data sources. For more information, visit , connect through LinkedIn or follow on Twitter @AtroposHealth.

NEW YORK, March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- For patients with psychiatric conditions, illness severity and instability are key factors in predicting future risk of hospitalization, according to a new study by Holmusk, a leading behavioral health real-world evidence and data analytics company, that has been published in The Lancet Psychiatry. The study, which was enabled by Holmusk's NeuroBlu Database, could prove useful across the behavioral health care and research ecosystem, from facilitating early intervention to supporting the development of more targeted treatments.
The research was conducted using Holmusk's NeuroBlu Database, a real-world data source that contains longitudinal, de-identified data from the electronic health records of more than 1.4 million patients receiving care for behavioral health conditions at over 30 health systems across the U.S. Researchers examined the associations among clinical severity, instability, and psychiatric hospitalization, producing the first study to explore whether early clinical trajectory serves as a predictor of psychiatric hospitalization across diagnoses. In addition to publication in the peer-reviewed The Lancet Psychiatry, findings from the study also have been presented in recent weeks at Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy's annual meeting, held this year in San Antonio, and at the annual European Congress of Psychiatry, held this year in Paris. 
""Our vision in creating the NeuroBlu Database was to provide the gold standard for behavioral health real-world data,"" said Nawal Roy, Founder and CEO of Holmusk. ""Findings like these validate that this vision is being realized. Even more importantly, they underscore the importance of developing standardized measures across behavioral health care in order to improve patient care and outcomes.""
The research team, led by clinical psychiatrist and University of Oxford senior research fellow Maxime Taquet, found that patients who experienced severe illness and instability within the first two months of their clinical encounters had a significantly higher risk of psychiatric hospitalization within six months. In fact, patients ranking in the top half for clinical severity and instability had a 45% increased risk of hospitalization. Researchers used scores from the Clinical Global Impression Severity scale (CGI-S) to measure both clinical severity and instability. 
The study, which included over 36,000 patients, also found that this association remained consistent across a wide range of diagnoses, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other behavioral health conditions. The association was seen in both adults and children, and in both men and women. To further establish the strength of the association, researchers replicated the analysis with a different group of patients, this time using the patient-reported outcome measure Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Their findings complemented results from the original analysis.
""Holmusk's NeuroBlu Database is an invaluable resource whose real-world data made this analysis possible,"" Taquet said. ""Not only does the NeuroBlu Database include frequently collected psychometric scales, such as the CGI-S used in this study, but it also includes longitudinal data across diverse treatment centers, including emergency rooms and hospitals. The completeness of this EHR-derived data enabled us to examine patients' clinical journeys and determine whether they had been admitted to the hospital within the first six months after initiating care.""
The research has implications for many areas across the behavioral health ecosystem. In clinical practice, providers could use severity and instability to aid in making decisions, such as which patients might benefit from intensive interventions. Hospitals and health systems could use this information in planning provision of care, such as predicting need for psychiatric hospital beds. Finally, researchers could use these findings to accelerate the development of new interventions that aim to prevent hospitalization or to help recruit specific patient cohorts based on their hospitalization risk.
Additional authors of the paper include Holmusk contributors Kira Griffiths, Emily Palmer, Sheryl Ker, and Christian Liman, as well as former Holmusk contributors Soon Nan Wee, Scott Kollins, and Rashmi Patel. In addition to his role at University of Oxford, Taquet has a consultancy contract to conduct research at Holmusk.

SAN RAMON, Calif., March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Reputation, a global leader in reputation experience management, has announced its ranking of the top 30 U.S. healthcare systems in its 2023 Healthcare Reputation Report. The report's key findings include:
Engagement is the biggest differentiator in leaders vs. laggards in the healthcare industry.
Patient experience extends to every conceivable touchpoint both online and in person.
Patients are more willing to engage in reviews and surveys than ever before.
Reputation analyzed over 1 million patient reviews across 200,000 physicians and hospitals and surveyed consumers about how they search for care. Reputation found:
Ratings/reviews influence someone's choice of a provider more than ever. About 86% of consumers say they read online patient reviews, which is up from 72% last year.
Patients are speaking up about their experiences. Review volume is up nearly 50% from 2022.
High ratings are table stakes for providers. 73% of consumers say a minimum star rating of 4 stars is needed for them to engage with a provider or physician.
The report's analysis of patient sentiment underscored the importance of frontline staff in creating a positive patient experience. For hospitals and physicians, the top three drivers of positive sentiment were staff, bedside manner and competence of the physician.
""A hospital's star rating is largely determined by feedback left online by those receiving care or seeking it for their loved ones. Healthcare providers need to have robust review requesting programs that help them collect, manage and respond to patient feedback,"" said Joe Fuca, CEO of Reputation. ""Hospitals without active review request and response programs are wasting critical opportunities to engage with and learn from their patients. Even ChatGPT recommended this when we asked it how healthcare marketers can improve online ratings! It's no longer feasible for leaders to cut corners on these essential programs, and the costs are tangible. Patients are demonstrating their preference by selecting more engaged providers.""
Healthcare Provider Rankings
Reputation analyzed the 30 largest healthcare systems in the United States and ranked them by Reputation Score, which is the aggregated scores of acute care facilities within each healthcare system. The top 15 RepScore leaders are:
Community Health Systems
HCA Healthcare
AdventHealth
Universal Health Services
Sutter Health
Baylor Scott & White Health
Ascension
University of Texas System
Tenet Healthcare Corp.
CommonSpirit Health
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
Kaiser Permanente

""Using feedback from our patients - and often their family members, too - helps guide continuous improvement in our services, customer experience and overall satisfaction. We're proud to be recognized in the 2023 Healthcare Report by Reputation for efforts that have amplified the voice of the customer and for our work to use those insights in ways that can enhance customer acquisition, experience and loyalty,"" said Tomi Galin, EVP, Corporate Communications and Marketing, Community Health Systems.
The Reputation Score looks at nine elements including review sentiment, volume, recency, spread, length, and response. The top-ranked healthcare systems in Reputation's analysis outperformed everyone in patient sentiment by 39 points, engagement (response rate) by 89 points, and visibility by 14 points.
According to Reputation, providers can make ratings/reviews work for them by creating a central feedback hub for collecting patient sentiment from surveys, ratings/reviews and social media and then making improvements to the patient experience based on that feedback.
Acting on consumer feedback can take your patient experience from complex and fragile to intuitive and strong. For more insights, download our 2023 Healthcare Reputation Report.

Perrigo announced in July 2022 that its HRA Pharma affiliate filed an application with the FDA for the Rx-to-OTC switch of Opill®, a progestin-only daily birth control pill (also referred to as a mini pill or non-estrogen pill). If approved, Opill® would be the first ever daily birth control pill available OTC, without a prescription, in the U.S. Over-the-counter birth control has support from major medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Women's Health is one of Perrigo's strategic growth pillars. Having recognized its importance to society and its growth potential, the Company has recently created a dedicated global Women's Health strategic organization, with specific focus on the sexual health needs of women. From expanded contraceptive options, to products that help people understand and manage their fertility, to helping women adjust to perimenopause, the Women's Health strategic organization will partner with women and people as experts in their own bodies and sexual health to help provide them with support and solutions at every step. The Company believes access to affordable birth control is an important next step and will work diligently with the FDA to gain its approval.

76ececd4-a41a-39c8-97ff-736435d5cb03,How To Restore the Skin’s Microbiome From Over-sanitizing,"Father and son using wash hand sanitizer gel in the park before a snack.
Many people use hand sanitizer constantly. They carry miniature bottles with them, help themselves to sanitizer stations out in public, and even make their own at home during sanitizer shortages.
Measures used to prevent the spread of viruses, such as increased frequency of hand washing and the use of hand sanitizers, are likely helpful in slowing the spread of illnesses. However, that frequency of use also has a significant impact on the skin barrier and the skin biomes, potentially causing dysbiosis, which can lead to undesirable skin issues.
In this article, we’ll unpack the causes of each of these issues, as well as how to help restore the skin biome when such issues arise.
The ancillary effects of attempted hand sanitizing
Simply washing hands with water removes most transient microbes that we pick up throughout the day, and washing with soap will absolutely do the trick. While alcohol-based hand sanitizers are very useful in settings where there is an increase in the transmission of pathogens (such as hospitals), there are no additional health benefits to habitual hand sanitizing unless a person doesn’t have access to running water.
Any time we attempt to sterilize the skin — through hand sanitizing or hand washing — we adjust the skin biome to some capacity, depending on how aggressively we wash and how antimicrobial the soaps or sanitizers are. However, we can never literally sanitize the skin with those methods.
For instance, if we touch something “germy,” it is likely that washing our hands with a gentle cleanser will remove any surface-level, transient microbes we might have picked up. Yet, many people are seeking out soaps and detergents that claim to have the most antimicrobial activity but are also extremely harsh on the skin. Such products not only kill any pathogenic microbes on the surface of the skin, but also kill the majority of the commensal, or “good,” microbes. They also strip the skin’s natural barrier, making it more likely a person would get an infection. By over-cleansing or over-sanitizing, it is also possible to increase the risk of infection from opportunistic pathogens. So, when it comes to protecting ourselves against airborne pathogens, the real question is where, is the line between clean enough and too clean?
Then, there is the safety of the products we use to consider. With the surge in demand for hand sanitizers in recent years came an onslaught of products that had alcohol contents either higher or lower than advertised, which can affect how effective they are in killing microbes. Additionally, impurities, such as benzyne, were found in many products, bringing into question whether they were safe to use. These are things we cannot identify simply by picking up a bottle of sanitizer, and most of us don’t have analytical chemistry labs at our disposal. So, we were at the mercy of those companies making the sanitizers. Additionally, depending on the formulation of the sanitizers, they can be very drying and strip the skin barrier as well.
How to restore the skin biome and barrier
So, how can we help our skin get back to normal? Well, the answer is simple. Get rid of excessive cleansing habits and adopt a more moderate hygiene routine. Wash your hands or use sanitizers in a reasonable way. When left alone, the skin biome tends to be able to restore its balance. When microbiomes are allowed to grow again, they usually find healthy equilibriums naturally.
Most microbiomes are resilient and will reestablish themselves at healthy levels when we stop excessive sanitizing habits. Like most things in life, it’s all about balance. Wash your hands when you need to, but don’t wash just because it’s a habit or you “feel dirty.” If you haven’t touched anything that someone with a contagious pathogen has or may have touched recently, then you might want to reconsider whether you need to wash or sanitize your hands.
Trust your immune system
The more things we expose our immune systems to, the stronger they get. The fact is that if we were as susceptible to bacteria and getting contaminated as some would lead us to believe, we would quickly die after birth. Sure, some people are immunocompromised and require a bit of extra care, but this is not the norm — only 2% of the population are immunocompromised). Still, despite having very capable and functional immune systems, we continue to over-sanitize and over-cleanse.
The skin is one of the largest (if not the largest) immune organs in the body. So, what grows on the skin does affect our immune systems and health overall. Once we embrace that healthy skin is always going to be covered in billions of microbes — all the time — it can change our outlook on what constitutes healthy hygiene.
The fact that our skin is covered in microbes is not up for debate; it is just fact. Whether the majority of microbes are the “healthy” kind is the real question. Much of this depends on how we take care of our skin and whether we allow our skin to self-regulate using topicals focused on whole-skin biome care or whether we opt to disrupt the environment of the skin with products that are not conducive to biome balance. The more we help the public understand the necessity of maintaining the skin biome and building — and trusting — our immune systems, the healthier we’ll become as a society."

05194e6f-0f3a-3d6d-be47-a1985297cbc5,医保局严查超标采购集采落选药，大批医院被点名,01各地集采执行情况通报多家大三甲、药企被点名 据业内消息，国家医保局日前发布2023年9号文件，通报了部分药品集中带量采购执行情况，其中使用集采中选药品占比低的省市、医院被公开点名，据悉，国家医保局还要求各省进行针对性自查，全面排查集采中选药品的履约情况。  各省已纷纷展开行动，贵州、江西、河南等多地在近期发布了当地集采药品使用情况通报。 今日（3月28日），贵州省医保局发布《关于第六批国家组织药品集中带量采购（胰岛素专项）执行情况的通报》表示“国家医保局近期再次对胰岛素集采执行情况进行通报，省医保局按要求开展核查”。 此次通报针对胰岛素集采落地整体情况以及进度滞后的品种、地区、医疗机构进行了点名（完整名单见文末附1）。 其中，合肥天麦、宜昌东阳光、波兰佰通（合肥亿帆）、浙江海正及江苏万邦5家企业实际采购进度仅26%至56%不等；具体到品种，礼来制药餐时人胰岛素 （0.00%）、合肥天麦基础人胰岛素（4.40%）、宜昌东阳光餐时人胰岛素（28.00%）等12个品种未达任务进度；此外，还有多家医院因采购进度滞后被点名，其中不乏贵医附院等大三甲。  据山西太原一区医保局3月27日消息，近期，山西省医保局向辖区内各地发布了《关于部分药品集中带量采购执行情况的通报》《药品耗材带量采购2022年全年中选结果执行情况通报》，各市县区依文件展开约谈会，会上强调内容包括阿托伐他汀钙、氨氯地平、硫酸沙丁胺醇吸入溶液剂和胰岛素采购使用情况等。 3月16日，江西省医保局发布《关于部分药品集中带量采购执行情况的通报》，重点针对采购阿托伐他汀钙非中选药品、氨氯地平非中选药品比例高且金额较大的医疗机构进行了通报，共15家医疗机构被点名（未去重）。  本月初，江西鹰潭市医保局发布针对第六批国采的通报，文件显示，大部分胰岛素专项中选产品完成率较高，但各级医疗机构均存在一些品规实际采购数据为0的情况，涉及鹰潭市中医院、贵溪县人民医院等。 除上述已通报执行情况的地区外，部分省的监测工作仍在进行中。 2月末，辽宁省卫健委发布《关于开展2023年公立医疗卫生机构药品使用监测工作的通知》，监测数据釆集范围覆盖全省所有的三级和二级公立医疗机构，以及政府办基层医疗卫生机构，按照计划，通过国家药品使用监测系统给各地的基础质控结果反馈将在4月14日前完成。02医保局：及时约谈督导与纪检监察部门联动处置从上述各省的通报情况来看，部分医疗机构仍存在非中选药品使用量多于中选药品、采购药品价格明显高于平均价格等情况。针对这一现象，原陕西山阳县卫健局副局长徐毓才曾对赛柏蓝表示，主要存在两方面原因，一是中选药品存在利润率低的现实情况，从医生和医疗机构的角度出发，对这一药品的使用可能选择的更少；二是中选产品存在供应问题，医疗机构的报量和需求相差较大的情况下，也可能更多的使用了非中选药品。对集采中选、非中选药品使用情况进行监控、通报的主要目的正在于促进医疗机构使用中选产品，从而进一步推动集采结果落地。包括监控、通报等措施在内，还有省份对集采全流程更新了管理规范，针对集采中出现的不规范现象或将与纪检监察部门联动处置。3月20日，山东省医保局发布《关于加强药品和医用耗材集中带量采购全流程管理的通知》（下文简称《通知》，全文见文末附2），涉及报量不准、报量不采、配送率低等多项问题，具体举措将于今年4月10日起施行。《通知》提到的重点监测范围包括中选产品采购进度、中选产品采购数量占比、非中选产品和可替代（完全可替代、大部分可替代）药品采购情况，以及抽查监测违规线下采购、超常规订单、不及时确认收货等情况。对不报量仍大量采购中选产品、中选产品实际采购量超出约定采购量4倍的医疗机构，医保部门结合医疗机构历史采购数据督导医疗机构作出说明。对存在采购进度低于序时进度、中选产品采购数量占比明显偏低特别是非中选产品采购数量超过中选产品采购数量、可替代药品采购数量超过上一年度采购数量，甚至不报量仍大量采购非中选产品或可替代药品等问题的医疗机构，至少每季度一次通报提醒。同时，考虑到部分高价药背后可能存在带金销售空间等问题，多地在采购进度监测过程中联合了纪检监察部门。山东就在此次《通知》中明确，对通报整改不到位的医疗机构应及时进行约谈督导，与纪检监察部门联动处置，并与集中带量采购结余留用专项考核、医保协议管理等工作做好衔接。在集采药品用量监测体系下，医疗机构面临预警提示、通报提醒、约谈督导、与纪检监察部门联动处置等措施，药企面临报量风险提示、减少约定采购量、不接受参加集采等惩戒，灰色推广行为迁移、集采结果不落地等问题出现的频次也将随之减少。附1：贵州《关于第六批国家组织药品集中带量采购（胰岛素专项）执行情况的通报》附2：山东《关于加强药品和医用耗材集中带量采购全流程管理的通知》END作者 | 陈芋微信：DistillareChen不想错过赛柏蓝每日资讯，点击在看⬇️‍

5f22fe1c-aa29-3109-9b07-8423427d99ad,效果优于奥司他韦，它会成为下个年销60亿的新王吗？,"根据中国国家流感中心数据2023年3月13日-2023年3月19日，目前流感仍处于爆发高峰期，根据下图2022-2023年红色数据，目前流感是近几年的最高峰。01我国流感用药情况2022年12月发布的《成人流行性感冒诊疗规范急诊专家共识（2022版）》中新增了玛巴洛沙韦片这一款抗流感病毒药物。至此，流感的主要用药有奥司他韦、扎那米韦、帕拉米韦、阿比多尔和玛巴洛沙韦这5种，但从市场角度来看，奥司他韦一家独大。来源：成人流行性感冒诊疗规范急诊专家共识 （2022 版）从专家共识的表格里面看，玛巴洛沙韦较于奥司他韦疗效优势更大，如奥司他韦需要服用5天，而玛巴洛沙韦只需服用1次，就能在24小时内停止病毒复制，玛巴洛沙韦不良反应更少，不易产生耐药性，能治疗对奥司他韦产生抗性的病毒株和禽流感病毒株等优势。2023年3月22日，罗氏与华润医药官宣合作共同推广玛巴洛沙韦，罗氏负责全国主要医院市场的渠道推广，华润医药负责线上下零售市场及部分下沉市场的渠道推广。在华润医药强势入局的情况下，东阳光药能否维持自己流感药老大的格局？毕竟东阳光的可威曾在2019年达到近60亿销售额，属于当之无愧的流感龙头。关于流感新药玛巴洛沙韦还有个故事，去年10月罗氏针对石药欧意（即石药集团）所研发的玛巴洛沙韦片仿制药提起专利链接诉讼，说石药集团仿制药即便获批顺利也不能销售，但到底专利诉讼的结果如何，还得看双方法务部门的博弈。在未来的流感药市场竞争中，说不定石药集团的玛巴洛沙韦片仿制药可能也会参与，那时可能会出现三足鼎立的局面了。02‍我国目前流感用药销售情况根据中康SIC零售药店实时销售数据，在2月1日-3月21日期间（3月指截止到3月21日数据），奥司他韦和玛巴洛沙韦的销售额和销量都呈现出波动性增长。从整体趋势来看，两种药品的销售额和销量在2月中旬开始迅速上升，然后在3月初达到顶峰，随后开始逐渐下降。奥司他韦：销售额在2月14日至2月17日间出现显著增长，从13万增长至94万元，增幅高达616%，在2月27日达到最高点为1,472万；单价波动较小，在72至110元之间。奥司他韦销售情况玛巴洛沙韦的销售额和销量相对较低，但在2月26日至3月14日间呈现出较为明显的增长，2月26日的销售额不到1万，而3月14日的销售额达到29万，增幅高达3384%，从产品单价的变化来看，玛巴洛沙韦的单价在2月3日至3月21日间波动较大，从189元增长至230元，但整体趋势上呈现出稳步上升。玛巴洛沙韦销售情况在2-3月汇总的销售额方面，东阳光药业以1.74亿元的总销售额遥遥领先于其他公司。其次是倍特药业（约7,948万元）和碧生源（约6,756万元），倍特药业的销售额增长最为显著，从约2,196万元增至约5,752万元，增幅达到了约162%。从产品单价来看，维健医药的奥司他韦单价最高，2-3月汇总单价为239元。而在2月份，贝美药业的奥司他韦单价发生了显著变化，从123元上涨至3月份的153元，涨幅约为24%。此外，复星医药在3月份的奥司他韦单价相较2月份下降了约20%，从133元降至106元。流感用药销售情况流感用药销售情况总体来看，东阳光药业在奥司他韦市场的表现最为抢眼，几乎是一家独大的局面，销售额和销量均领先于其他竞争对手，而流感新药玛巴洛沙韦销售占比较低，倍特药业的奥司他韦在2月至3月的销售额和销量增长表现优秀。流感用药具有很强的周期性，会随着流感爆发而出现销量暴涨，而玛巴洛沙韦是在2021年才进入中国市场，2021年12月成功进入新版医保目录，但目前在流感用药占比仍然较低。03‍‍结语预防永远是比治疗要好，预防流感分为暴露前预防和暴露后预防，暴露前预防主要是接种流感疫苗，暴露后预防主要是使用抗病毒药物如奥司他韦和玛巴洛沙韦。但药物不能代替流感疫苗在预防流感中的作用，仅是未接种流感疫苗或接种流感疫苗后尚未获得免疫能力的重症高危人群暴露后的紧急临时预防措施。从经济性的角度来说，接种流感疫苗是应对流感的最佳预防手段。根据中国流感疫苗预防接种技术指南（2022-2023）的数据：流感门诊总经济负担在464~1,320元之间，住院总经济负担在9,832~25,768元之间。不幸感染流感去门诊或住院的话，至少需要大几百甚至几千到上万元，而流感疫苗在50-300元，流感治疗药物奥司他韦价格为130-200元/5天疗程，玛巴洛沙韦约220-230元/次。END作者 | 天河老梅西来源｜新康界不想错过赛柏蓝每日资讯，点击在看⬇️"

02efaf19-bff0-3782-b709-182adca5b764,Masimo unveils Freedom health-tracking smartwatch,"Irvine, California-based Masimo says it designed its Freedom smartwatch to “revolutionize the wearable technology industry.” Along with continuous health tracking, it features novel hardware for reducing radiation and freeing users from privacy infringement.
The company said in a news release that the technology builds upon the Masimo W1 advanced biosensing watch. Freedom leverages a state-of-the-art sensor and digital signal processing technology. It provides continuous, accurate, and reliable readings of key health data. That includes arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), hydration index (Hi), pulse rate, heart rate and respiration rate.
Freedom integrates Masimo’s health-tracking technology with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and LTE connectivity. This enables the everyday conveniences of texting, calling, music and third-party app compatibility. Masimo Freedom also features a physical privacy switch that instantly stops all sharing data beyond the device. That includes user data, as well as microphone, location, and metadata.
“We believe that this groundbreaking new product will revolutionize wearable technology and health tracking,” said Masimo founder and CEO Joe Kiani. “We are allowing people to take control of their health with continuous and accurate actionable biosensing information along with the convenience of being connected, but without compromising their freedom.”
More about the Masimo Freedom
Masimo Freedom also utilizes technology based on Masimo SET pulse oximetry. It optimizes the capture of health data from the wrist.
The company also intends to introduce a sleek, screenless band built on innovations for W1 and Freedom. Masimo designed the band to work in tandem and synchronize with Freedom, allowing a user to wear one while charging the other. This creates a 24/7 continuous wear ecosystem, maximizing health tracking abilities all day.
Masimo said consumers can pre-order Freedom now with a fully refundable $100 deposit. It expects shipping to begin this fall, while shipping for W1 remains underway. Masimo also expects to have its band ready for sale this summer.
The company continues to make waves in the health monitoring space. In January, it extended a partnership with Philips to augment patient monitoring capabilities at home with W1. The advanced health-tracking watch first launched to early adopters in May 2022. It holds CE mark approval while FDA clearance is pending.
This system represents part of Masimo’s recently announced plan to turn home entertainment systems into health hubs."

ba87b06e-bd4f-35a2-82e1-1975d385e48b,Covant and Boehringer Ingelheim Collaborate to Develop a Novel ADAR1 Inhibitor for Use in Cancer Patients,"BOSTON, March  28, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Covant Therapeutics, an innovative covalent drug discovery company, has entered into an exclusive research collaboration and worldwide licensing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim covering Covant’s ADAR1 program. The companies jointly aim to develop a novel small molecule immunotherapy targeting ADAR1 to transform the lives of cancer patients.    Covant significantly accelerates drug discovery for challenging targets like ADAR1 by using its industry-leading platform, which combines high-throughput chemoproteomics-based screening in the native setting with structural proteomics. Covant is systematically applying its platform to discover novel, high-value first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics.    The Covant-Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration seeks to create an ADAR1 inhibitor that could be used in combination with other immunotherapies to increase their efficacy. To date, existing immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment but only work in a minority of patients. Inhibiting ADAR1 has the potential to address this challenge by transforming “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors, which have more immune cells present in the tumor micro-environment.    “ADAR1 is an exciting immuno-oncology target with significant therapeutic potential,” said Lamine Mbow, Global Head of Cancer Immunology & Immune Modulation, Boehringer Ingelheim. “We are committed to transforming the lives of cancer patients by delivering meaningful advances with the ultimate goal of curing a range of cancers. By partnering with Covant’s exceptional scientific team and powerful platform, we aim to bring next-generation immunotherapies to cancer patients.”    “We look forward to working with the scientists at Boehringer Ingelheim to advance our program against ADAR1, a key, hard-to-drug immuno-oncology target,” said Dr. Ivan Cornella, Chief Scientific Officer of Covant. “Boehringer Ingelheim has a leading oncology and immuno-oncology pipeline and their decision to work with Covant is a testament to the strength of our team and approach.”    Under the terms of the agreement, Covant will be responsible for the discovery of ADAR1 small molecule inhibitors. In turn, Covant will receive an upfront payment of $10 million and will be eligible for up to $471 million in additional milestone payments along with tiered royalties on global sales.    About Covant TherapeuticsCovant Therapeutics is a Boston-based covalent drug discovery company that was incubated by Roivant Sciences (NASDAQ: ROIV). Covant creates novel therapeutics by using covalency to imprint and regulate proteins. To discover these therapeutics, the company applies cutting-edge capabilities and expertise in chemistry, quantitative proteomics, translational sciences, and deep learning.

e2382af8-779d-36fb-9573-37ff3061501d,Anebulo Pharmaceuticals Announces Positive Complete Phase 2 Clinical Data Demonstrating Potential of ANEB-001 as a Treatment for Acute Cannabinoid Intoxication,"ANEB-001 statistically significantly reduced VAS Feeling High in all cohorts (p=<0.0001 at the 30 mg THC dose level)
A single 10 mg oral dose of ANEB-001 reduced key symptoms of Accute Cannabinoid Intoxication induced in healthy volunteers by 30 mg challenge dose of oral THC
Delayed dosing of ANEB-001 rapidly reversed pre-existing THC effects
ANEB-001 was well tolerated
Targeting End of Phase 2A (EOP2A) meeting with FDA by mid 2023
AUSTIN, Texas, March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- 
Anebulo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANEB) (the ""Company"" or ""Anebulo""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel solutions for people suffering from acute cannabinoid intoxication (""ACI"") and substance addiction, today announced complete results from its randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ANEB-001 as a potential treatment for ACI in healthy volunteers challenged with oral delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (""THC""). Part B of the study was an adaptive design that included six cohorts of up to 15 healthy adults to examine different doses of THC and ANEB-001, and the impact of delayed dosing of ANEB-001 or placebo. In total, Parts A and B of the Phase 2 study enrolled 134 healthy subjects.
""The positive results of the Phase 2 proof of concept study are very encouraging and will have significant clinical implications for the unmet need of patients presenting to emergency departments with ACI,"" said Simon Allen, Chief Executive Officer of Anebulo. ""We believe the complete data from this study, together with data from our observational study in ACI subjects and our PK/PD modeling efforts, will provide support for the design of a registrational trial. We are in the process of requesting an End of Phase 2A meeting with FDA to discuss the final data from this study. We expect the meeting to occur within 75 days from the date of the request but acknowledge that it could be longer."" 
Final ANEB-001 Part 2 Proof of Concept Study Results
Data from Part A of the study previously showed positive protective effects of a single oral dose of 50 or 100 mg ANEB-001 when co-administered with an oral challenge dose of 10.5 mg THC. In Part B of the study, subjects were challenged with substantially higher oral doses of THC (21, 30, or 40 mg) and treated with lower doses of ANEB-001 (10 or 30 mg) or a matching placebo. Delayed dosing of ANEB-001 was also examined by introducing a one-hour pause between the THC challenge and treatment with the ANEB-001 or placebo. The final cohort of the study included the administration of a high-fat meal prior to the THC challenge.
Based on the final data for Part B of the study, a single low oral dose of ANEB-001 (10 mg) administered 1 hour after a THC challenge rapidly and statistically significantly reversed key psychotropic effects of THC doses as high as 30 mg, including a reduction in the visual analog scale (VAS) for feeling high (p=<0.0001) and improvement in VAS alertness (p=0.0042) and reduced body sway (p=0.0196). In a pre-specified pooled analysis of data for the combined 21 mg or 30 mg THC dose levels, a single 10 mg of ANEB-001 administered one hour after THC achieved statistical significance on all primary outcomes, including a reduction in VAS feeling high (p=<0.0001), improvement in VAS alertness (p=0.0024), reduced body sway (p=0.0014), and reduction in heart rate (p=0.0125). ANEB-001 also reduced the time required for the THC effects to normalize back to baseline.
""With these final data from the Phase 2 proof of concept study we have shown favorable tolerability and efficacy data of ANEB-001 in rapidly reversing the effects of a THC challenge, reinforcing the preliminary data previously reported,"" said Ken Cundy, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Anebulo.  ""These positive data showed that delayed ANEB-001 treatment after a THC challenge produced statistically significant improvements in all key outcomes, as well as improvements in other exploratory outcomes, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of ANEB-001 for the treatment of ACI. This successful study is the result of the hard work of the Anebulo team and our colleagues at the Centre for Human Drug Research (""CHDR"") in the Netherlands. We look forward to presenting additional details from the study at a future scientific meeting.""
The Phase 2 study was conducted in the Netherlands by the CHDR. A total of 134 healthy subjects were enrolled. All subjects received oral THC challenge doses. In total, 91 subjects received single oral doses of ANEB-001. Pharmacodynamic outcomes were assessed by mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) through 8 hours post-ANEB-001 dosing. Safety was assessed by continuous observation through 24 hours and followed up at 7 to 14 days after treatment.  ANEB-001 was well tolerated in this study and there were no serious adverse events. At the 30 mg THC dose, prior to dosing ANEB-001 or placebo, subjects developed mild to moderate THC-related symptoms including moderate euphoria, nausea, and/or vomiting, and mild bradyphrenia, dizziness, paresthesia, and/or feeling emotional. After delayed dosing of 10 mg ANEB-001 or placebo following a 21 mg or 30 mg THC challenge dose, the adverse events considered possibly or probably related to ANEB-001 were mild except for one case of moderate nausea/vomiting at THC doses of 21 mg and 30 mg; the incidence of dizziness and euphoria was greater in the placebo treated subjects. Administration of a high-fat meal delayed the absorption of THC resulting in blunted effects of a 30 mg THC dose on many of the outcomes. However, delayed dosing of 10 mg ANB-001 still significantly reduced VAS feeling high in fed subjects (p=0.0030).

NEW YORK and TEL AVIV, Israel, March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Zorro, a pioneer in optimizing the health benefits experience for employees, employers and brokers, today announced its launch out of stealth, along with an $11.5 million seed funding round co-led by Pitango and 10D. The funds will be used to further expand R&D efforts and scale customer operations.
The process of offering employee benefits is complicated, opaque and burdensome. For employers and brokers, offering benefits often results in unpredictable budgets, endless administration, and a distraction from the core business. For employees, health benefits are generic and too often, completely out of their control.
Zorro analyzes employers' benefit objectives to create a top-down predictable budget and benefit allowance per employee or group of employees. It also provides an end-to-end insurance management solution that offers a single, comprehensive platform making administering benefits seamless and effective. Additionally, Zorro acts as a financial companion and analyzes employees' healthcare needs, family situation, risk tolerance and other personal characteristics. It then generates a recommended benefit bundle consisting of health insurance, supplemental coverages, specialized digital health solutions, and other financial value-add services.
""Zorro sits at the exciting intersection of the healthcare and financial sectors, and we're proud to have developed a technology that makes offering employee health insurance plans more transparent, cost-effective and personalized,"" said Guy Ezekiel, CEO and co-founder of Zorro. ""Our solution flips the outdated health benefits model upside down and gives employers predictability, while providing employees with the coverage that best fits their needs. The multi-disciplinary expertise that exists among the Zorro team members, including in healthcare, insuretech, software and big data, is a unique asset that allows us to accomplish our important mission of improving access to quality and affordable healthcare.""
""Zorro's founders have leveraged their strong backgrounds in healthcare, financial investments and technology to address an unmet need in the market,"" said Rami Kalish, Managing Partner and Co-Founder of Pitango. ""This new model that simplifies the employee health benefit selection process will undoubtedly see quick adoption by small to medium-sized businesses due to its ease of use and immediate return on investment.""
""Almost 90% of employers plan to make changes to their health vendor partnerships in the next two years, but are still lacking the tools to offer employees personalized health insurance,"" said Yahal Zilka, Managing Partner, at 10D. ""By prioritizing the health and financial requirements of employees, Zorro is putting the employee in control to ensure maximum and ideal insurance coverage.""
About Zorro
Zorro's vision is to be the healthcare financial companion of the future by improving access to quality and affordable healthcare to millions of Americans. Zorro provides an end-to-end solution optimizing the employee, employer, and broker benefits experience. Its platform optimizes how to allocate employers' budgets, moving from a ""one-size-fits-all"" offering to a modular, personalized model for employees. Founded by Guy Ezekiel and Maya Perl, veteran executives in the healthcare and investment fields, Zorro was developed with a deep understanding of the US healthcare system and the needs of both employers and employees.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Mission Bio, the pioneer in high-throughput single-cell DNA and multi-omics analysis, has joined the National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center for Cell Manufacturing Technologies (CMaT), leveraging its Tapestri® Platform to improve analytical assays and cell manufacturing processes. CMaT is a consortium of universities, companies, and clinical collaborators brought together to develop transformative tools and technologies for the consistent, scalable, and low-cost production of high-quality living therapeutic cells.
Launched in 2017, CMaT aims to revolutionize the treatment of cancer, heart disease, autoimmune diseases and other disorders by enabling broad use of potentially curative therapies that utilize living cells.
Consortium researchers will utilize Tapestri®'s single-cell multi-omics capabilities to streamline and improve analytical assays that are crucial for assessing quality during various stages of the cell therapy development process. Tapestri® can measure gene editing patterns at a high resolution, capturing the co-occurrence of on- and off-target edits, and the zygosity of edits, in individual cells that conventional bulk analyses cannot. This deeper characterization, which may have implications for safety and efficacy, can be completed within days and process thousands of cells at a time. Because Tapestri® enables measurement of genotypic and immunophenotypic attributes at single-cell resolution, it will be particularly useful for early cell therapy development to validate cell engineering techniques. 
Tapestri® will also be leveraged for improving and standardizing cell manufacturing processes, consolidating workflows measuring attributes like transduction efficiency and vector copy number that conventionally require weeks of clonal outgrowth and multiple assays to complete.
Mission Bio's mult-iomic capabilities are especially valuable for assessing gene editing or gene transfer strategies in target cell populations or types.
""In light of clinical holds, safety concerns, need for better understanding of product quality, and improving workflow bottlenecks that can delay approval and delivery of novel cell therapies to patients, we are pleased to partner with Mission Bio. Together, we aim to improve the development of safe, efficacious, and rapid delivery of critical therapies through better drug product molecular characterization on the Tapestri® Platform,"" said Krishnendu Roy, director of CMaT and Regents Professor and Robert A. Milton endowed in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University.
""We're proud to join this collaborative effort across various sectors to advance the field of cell therapy from within the community,"" said Anjali Pradhan, Senior Vice President of Product Management and Marketing at Mission Bio. ""It's imperative we face these challenges in manufacturing scalability and reproducibility as a united front, so that we can deliver these potentially life-saving therapies to patients safely and more rapidly.""
CMaT includes major university partners – Georgia Tech, the University of Georgia, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez campus – as well as affiliate partners such as the University of Pennsylvania, Emory University, University of Oregon, and the Morgridge Institute for Research. Additional international academic partners from Canada, Ireland, and Japan, as well as industry and the U.S. national laboratories, are critical collaborators.

0cf24c7d-09d9-314b-9dec-ff404d49877a,HMNC Brain Health and Develco Pharma Announce Last Patient Being Randomized in Oral Prolonged-Release Ketamine (KET01) Trial for Treatment-Resistant Depression,"KET01 Phase 2 Clinical Trial with Topline Results Expected Mid-YearMUNICH, Germany, March  28, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HMNC Brain Health (“HMNC'' or the “Company”), a global clinical stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of personalized therapies in psychiatry, together with Develco Pharma, announced today that the last patient has been randomized in its proof-of-concept Phase II clinical trial of ‘Ketabon’ (KET01), an oral prolonged-release ketamine formulation (KET01) for Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). Topline data from the Phase 2 trial, which is investigating efficacy, safety, and tolerability, is expected to be reported soon after the last study visit.  Enrollment in the Phase 2 trial commenced in June 2022 and 122 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have now been randomized at 29 clinical sites. Patients were selected based on current major depressive episodes not responding to a minimum of two standard antidepressants. The trial design enables the assessment of the oral prolonged-release formulation of ketamine that could sustainably transform the therapy of treatment-resistant depression, compared with the currently applied intravenous and intranasal ketamine and esketamine therapies.  “The goal with KET01 is to improve the lives of patients who are not responding to standard antidepressant therapies, as well as to provide a well-tolerated antidepressant with substantially limited dissociative side effects,” said Dr. Hans Eriksson, Chief Medical Officer at HMNC Brain Health. “We are very pleased that Ketabon is progressing positively along the pathway of approval and commercialization. The encouraging results we saw in a small Phase 2, proof-of-concept study, reported in 2022, highlighted the excellent tolerability of Ketabon, in combination with a numerically large improvement for patients treated with 240 mg/day Ketabon, and we look forward to receiving the results from our Phase 2 trial.”  Participants with TRD in the Phase 2 trial were randomized into three treatment groups and received a placebo, 120 mg/day KET01, or 240 mg/day KET01, given once daily (OD), in addition to their ongoing standard antidepressant treatment over a three-week period. The medication was taken at home. The primary endpoint was the change on the established Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score for depressive severity at day 21 compared to the placebo. Data from the previous Phase 2 trial suggested early-onset of efficacy, placebo-level dissociative side effects, and excellent tolerability, furthering the take-at-home potential of this novel treatment.  About HMNC Brain Health  HMNC Brain Health (HMNC Holding GmbH) is a global precision psychiatry biopharma company pioneering the development of personalized therapies powered by predictive companion diagnostics, leading to far shorter treatments and higher remission rates. The Company develops a unique pipeline for targeting both Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). The Company has operations both in the US and Germany and is backed by a renowned global VC, several family offices, and a strategic healthcare investor. The Company now enters the next stage of its development with a large-scale licensing and fundraising agenda.  About Develco Pharma  With headquarters in Pratteln/ Switzerland, Develco Pharma is a Swiss-German pharmaceutical company specializing in the development and manufacture of orally administered modified, prolonged & chrono-release drugs containing known active ingredients. Established in 2006, today the company has a workforce of 130 employees. In Germany, a state-of-the-art production facility for analgesics & other indications has been in operation in Schopfheim, in the Baden region, since 2016. Develco identifies and defines pharmaceutical products containing known active ingredients and develops generic, hybrid, value-added, and innovative formulations backed by clinical data for the delayed or modified release of active ingredients. On the strength of its experience and innovativeness, the company has emerged as an internationally recognized provider of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of several disease areas. The customer base of Develco Pharma includes global pharmaceutical groups. The company has some 180 market approvals in all (products of different dosages) in Europe, the US, Middle East, South Africa, Asia, and Australia.  About The Ketabon Program  The Ketabon program, a joint venture between HMNC Brain Health and Develco Pharma in Switzerland comprises an oral prolonged-release formulation of ketamine for TRD with minimal dissociative side effects. The pharmacokinetic profile of the prolonged-release formulation could significantly improve the risk profile and patient convenience, by minimizing dissociative side effects compared to the currently applied intravenous and intranasal ketamine therapies. TRD patients with insufficient response to standard antidepressants represent 30% of an overall estimated number of 320 million patients worldwide suffering from major depressive disorder. Clinical development of oral prolonged-release ketamine could also be potentially expanded into other indications beyond depression, such as anxiety, aggression, PTSD, and panic disorder.

VANCOUVER, BC and LAS VEGAS, March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - (CSE: OVAT) (OTCQB: OVATF) – Ovation Science Inc. (""Ovation"" or the ""Company""), a topical and transdermal cannabis product development company with a patented skin delivery technology Invisicare®, announces it has signed a Supply and Distribution Agreement with Golfer's CBD Ltd., an international CBD brand focused on the health and wellness of golfers around the world. The Agreement covers the rights in the golf market for the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe.
According to a recent survey, there are 66.6 million golf players in the world. Since 2019, Golfer's CBD Ltd. has been successfully targeting these players initially in the UK and then through the addition of a distribution partner in Central Europe and Scandinavia since 2021 (). The company sells its portfolio of CBD golf health and wellness products, designed and branded specifically for the golf industry through its e-commerce channels utilizing a robust AI-based (Artificial intelligence) online marketing engine, social media and through retail distribution partners.

The product line covers a range of CBD products from CBD gummies to oils and now Ovation's transdermal creams, all designed to enhance golfers' game preparation, playing skills and recovery.
""We are excited to have Golfer's CBD Ltd. introduce two of Ovation's transdermal formulations initially and make them available internationally. Since Ovation's creams contain CBD (Cannabidiol) which is non-psychoactive, it provides these athletes with a wide-range of health and mental benefits before, during and after their game; whether they are amateur or pro,"" said Terry Howlett, CEO of Ovation Science. He added, ""The marketing program that Golfer's CBD Ltd. has in place, will allow for Ovation to see immediate revenue on a monthly basis and even more significant sales revenue once other pending distribution agreements are finalized outside of the USA.""
""Golfer's CBD is an essential part of a golfer's kit because it helps golfers maximize their most valuable tools; their bodies and minds,"" said Andy Dixon, CEO of Golfer's CBD Ltd. ""We are thrilled to be able to feature Ovation Science's products in our portfolio. We pride ourselves in selecting only first class, highly effective products for our product line.

fa279afd-d512-3ea0-b34a-44ad44598497,Biomea Fusion Announces Positive Data from Initial Cohorts of Ongoing Phase II Study (COVALENT-111) of BMF-219 in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes; 100 mg Cohort 3 Demonstrated an 89% Response Rate and 1% Median Reduction in HbA1c at Day 28,"In Cohort 3, after 4 weeks of once-daily 100 mg dosing with the investigational, oral covalent menin inhibitor, BMF-219, 89% of patients achieved a reduction in A1c, 78% of patients achieved at least a 0.5% reduction in A1c, and 56% achieved at least a 1% reduction in A1c.Initial observations of continued glycemic control were seen in follow up visits in patients that had already reached week 8 in the study (4 weeks after the last BMF-219 dose) at the time of this publication.BMF-219 demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile. No patients on BMF-219 discontinued dosing and all patients completed 4 weeks of treatment.Biomea continues dose escalation of BMF-219 in COVALENT-111 and plans to explore additional dosing periods greater than 4 weeks in order to evaluate the optimal duration of glycemic control.Biomea plans to explore the potential clinical utility of BMF-219 in other diabetic patient populations, including type 1 diabetes.Biomea to host conference call on Tuesday, March 28th at 8:30 AM EDT.  REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March  28, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomea Fusion, Inc. (“Biomea”) (Nasdaq: BMEA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing novel covalent small molecules to treat and improve the lives of patients with genetically defined cancers and metabolic diseases, today announced initial positive topline data for the first two cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) enrolled in the Phase II portion of its ongoing Phase I/II clinical study (COVALENT-111) of BMF-219, the company’s novel, investigational covalent menin inhibitor.  Beta cell loss has been observed to be a critical component of the etiology and pathogenesis of both type 2 and type 1 diabetes; menin is thought to be a key inhibitory regulator that limits beta cell recovery in the pancreas. Using its proprietary FUSION™ System, Biomea designed BMF-219 to specifically inhibit menin to release the brakes on beta cells, and potentially enable their regeneration, reactivation, and preservation. This is the first clinical observation of patients with diabetes having a robust glucose-lowering response driven by an investigational menin inhibitor with a potentially disease-modifying mechanism of action, which may allow for continued glycemic control for prolonged periods even after treatment is stopped.  “Our goal with BMF-219 is to deliver the first disease-modifying treatment for patients with diabetes by addressing the root biological cause of the disease and its inevitable progression: the loss of insulin-producing beta cells. Today, we are seeing indications that we are achieving that goal and that BMF-219 may indeed be capable of regenerating, preserving, and reactivating healthy, functional beta cells. Moreover, we are seeing this impact and high level of glycemic control after just 4 weeks of treatment, a remarkably short timeframe, and at the first dose level, with highly favorable safety and tolerability,” said Thomas Butler, Biomea Fusion’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “More than 50% of the 27 million patients in the US diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have an A1c higher than 7%, indicating that their current treatments are not able to control their disease and their increased sugar levels may lead to harming their organs. With BMF-219, we believe we have the potential to radically transform the treatment of type 2 diabetes and help millions of patients – and these initial data certainly support that belief and excitement.”  Mr. Butler continued, “We are now exploring the various dose levels in the escalation portion of the study and will select the two most promising dose levels, to investigate the treatment length and with the goal of optimizing treatment responses and durability for the majority of diabetes patients. Importantly, these initial data also give us the confidence to continue our plans to move forward with evaluating BMF-219 as a potential treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes. This is an exciting day for the Biomea team, but most importantly an exciting day for patients with diabetes.”  Dr Jose E. Rodriguez, Internal Medicine & Medical Director at the Southwest General Healthcare Center (Fort Myers, Florida), a treating physician in COVALENT-111, added, “my patients had great benefits being included in COVALENT-111. The study drug showed hardly any side effects and was easily accepted. My patients are seeing positive health improvements, and I can literally say they are generally feeling better, overall happy and are enthusiastic, with more energy than they had before they started the study.”  Preliminary Clinical Data  40 patients were enrolled in the first three cohorts of COVALENT-111, with the first cohort (Cohort 1) comprising 16 healthy volunteers (HVs); 12 HVs were exposed to 100 mg BMF-219 once daily (QD) for two weeks and 4 HVs were exposed to placebo. In Cohorts 2 and 3, T2DM patients (n=12 per cohort with 10 patients treated with BMF-219 and 2 patients on placebo) received BMF-219 once daily for 4 weeks with or without food, respectively. In the two active treatment cohorts, enrolled patients had T2DM diagnosed for <15 years, were between the ages of 18 to 65, had been treated with lifestyle management together with up to three anti-diabetic medications, with a stable dose for at least two months prior to screening, had a BMI ≥25 and ≤40 kg/m2, and had poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤10%). At baseline, diabetic patients enrolled in the two active treatment cohorts, Cohorts 2 and 3, had a median A1c of 7.9 and 7.8%, respectively.  A negative food effect was seen between active treatment Cohort 3 (BMF-219 dosing without food) and Cohort 2 (BMF-219 dosing with food), which decreased the exposure significantly. Patients in active treatment Cohort 3 (taken without food) saw about a three-fold median increase in Cmax (ng/ml) and AUC (ng x h/ml) compared to Cohort 2 (taken with food).  Additional Clinical Observations:  Cohort 3: Patients on BMF-219 demonstrated a median A1c reduction: -1.0% and an 89% response rate at 4 weeks 78% of patients achieved a >0.5% reduction in A1c56% achieved a >1.0% reduction in A1c Cohort 2: Patients on BMF-219 had a median A1c reduction: -0.3% and a 70% response rate at 4 weeks 30% of patients achieved a >0.5% to <1.0% reduction in A1c Placebo: 4 diabetic patients on placebo had a median A1c and mean A1c reduction between -0.1% to -0.15%  In COVALENT-111 all patients are being assessed for changes in plasma glucose, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, C-peptide, fasting insulin, oral glucose tolerance testing, key metabolic and lipid parameters, including weight, triglycerides, cholesterol, and for durability of response after BMF-219 treatment has completed. Further analysis and a detailed data summary will be presented at an upcoming major medical meeting.  Initial Tolerability Data  BMF-219 was generally well tolerated; all patients completed the 4-week treatment, and all patients continue in follow-up to assess the durability of the treatment effect. There were no dose reductions, serious adverse events, or severe adverse events. In the active treatment Cohorts 2 and 3 (100 mg QD, n=24) 7 of 20 patients treated with BMF-219 showed mild (Grade 1) Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs), 1 of 20 patients treated with BMF-219 showed a moderate (Grade 2) TEAE and 2 of 4 patients treated with placebo showed mild (Grade 1) TEAEs. No patients showed symptomatic hypoglycemia and no other TEAEs were observed.  In the healthy volunteer Cohort 1 (100 mg QD, n=16), 2 of 12 subjects treated with BMF-219 and 1 of 4 subjects treated with placebo showed mild (Grade 1) TEAEs. No other TEAEs were observed.

COVALENT-111  COVALENT-111 is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II study. In the completed Phase I portion of the trial, healthy subjects were enrolled in single ascending dose cohorts to ensure safety at the prospective dosing levels for type 2 diabetic patients. Phase II consists of multiple ascending dose cohorts and includes adult patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by current therapies. Additional information about the Phase I/II clinical trial of BMF-219 in type 2 diabetes can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov using the identifier NCT05731544.  About Menin’s Role in Diabetes  Loss of functional beta cell mass is a core component of the natural history in both types of diabetes — type 1 diabetes (mediated by autoimmune dysfunction) and type 2 diabetes (mediated by metabolic dysfunction). Beta cells are found in the pancreas and are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy and helps control blood glucose levels. In patients with diabetes, beta cell mass and function have been observed to be diminished, leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Menin is thought to act as a brake on beta-cell turnover and growth, supporting the notion that inhibition of menin could lead to the regeneration of normal, healthy beta cells. Based on these and other scientific findings, Biomea is exploring the potential for BMF-219-mediated menin inhibition as a viable therapeutic approach to potentially halt or reverse progression of type 2 diabetes.  About Type 2 Diabetes  Diabetes is considered a chronic health condition that affects how the body turns food into energy and results in too much sugar in the bloodstream. Over time, this can cause serious health problems and damage vital organs. Most people with diabetes have a shorter life expectancy than people without this disease. The CDC estimates about 2 in 5 of the adult population in the USA are now expected to develop diabetes during their lifetime. More than 37 million people of all ages (about 11% of the US population) have diabetes today. 96 million adults (more than 1 in 3) have pre-diabetes, blood sugars that are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Diabetes is also one of the largest economic burdens on the United States health care system with $1 out of every $4 in US health care costs being spent on caring for people with diabetes. Despite the current availability of many diabetes medications, there remains a significant need in the treatment and care of patients with diabetes.  About Biomea Fusion  Biomea Fusion is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of covalent small molecules to treat patients with genetically defined cancers and metabolic diseases. A covalent small molecule is a synthetic compound that forms a permanent bond to its target protein and offers a number of potential advantages over conventional non-covalent drugs, including greater target selectivity, lower drug exposure, and the ability to drive a deeper, more durable response.

fe3d1b59-5134-3e98-8327-4b4501fd538e,Sci Adv：新型生物标志物或能帮助识别出人群胰腺癌的早期风险,"管内乳头状粘液瘤（IPMN，intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms）的组织病理学异质性往往使得科学家们预测机体患胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）的风险变得非常复杂。近日，一篇发表在国际杂志Science Advances上题为“Digital Spatial Profiling of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms: Towards a Molecular Framework for Risk Stratification”的研究报告中，来自美国杜克大学等机构的科学家们通过研究识别出了一组生物标志物，其或能帮助区分胰腺上的囊肿是否可能会进展为癌症或依然保持良性。这项研究标志着科学家们向开发临床方法又迈出了重要的一步，该方法或能帮助对胰腺上具有最高致癌风险的病变进行分类，并在其发生扩散之前还能帮助研究人员有效对病变部位进行移除。如果成功的话，这种基于生物标志物的方法或许就能解决降低机体患胰腺癌几率所面临的最大障碍，因为如今人类胰腺癌的发病率不断攀升，而且在机体腹部扫描时往往被偶然间发现时癌变部位就已经悄悄长大了。医学博士Peter Allen说道，即使胰腺癌在最早期阶段被发现，其几乎都总是在整个机体会脱落细胞，从而促使癌症复发。这就是为何研究人员将目光重点集中在癌变前的囊肿上的原因，即管内乳头状粘液瘤，大部分的管内乳头状粘液瘤永远不会进展为胰腺癌，但通过识别出哪些会发生进展，研究人员或许就能制造机会来预防不治之症的发展；文章中，研究人员利用一种名为数字空间RNA图谱分析的复杂分子生物学工具对囊肿中异常细胞生长的高级别和低级别区域进行定位分析。新型生物标志物或能帮助识别出人群胰腺癌的早期风险。图片来源：Science Advances (2023). DOI:10.1126/sciadv.ade4582此前研究人员描述管内乳头状粘液瘤特征的方法并不太精准，而且也并不能识别出指示癌症风险的准确标志物，然而，这种数字空间分析的技术或许就能促使研究人员选择单个细胞组进行分析，也能帮助识别出一系列基因突变，这些突变能助长并潜在抑制胰腺癌的发生和进展。研究人员还识别出了能有效区分两种管内乳头状粘液瘤突变体的标志物，而且发现了一种能定义第三种常见突变体的不同标记，这种突变通常会导致较少的侵袭性疾病的发生。研究者Allen说道，我们发现了非常明显的高级别细胞异常的标志物，以及生长缓慢的亚型，目前我们的研究重点是在囊肿液体中找到这种标志物，如果能在囊肿液体中识别出特殊的标志物，或许就能为蛋白质活检提供一定的基础，并能帮助指导是否应该在癌症发生和扩散之前对囊肿进行移除。当前的诊断性策略的总体准确率大约为60%，包括临床、放射学、实验室、内窥镜和细胞学分析等。如今，全球人群中胰腺癌的发病率不断上升，如果目前的趋势继续下去的话，在未来几年里胰腺癌将会成为美国人群因癌症死亡的第二大原因，而且目前研究人员尚不清楚到底是什么因素在驱动胰腺癌发病率的上升。一些研究表明炎症或许在其中扮演着重要角色，而目研究人员正在进行相关的临床试验来检测是否抗炎性疗法能帮助减少管内乳头状粘液瘤患者机体癌症的发生，综上，本文研究结果揭示了人类高风险管内乳头状粘液瘤的特殊标志物，并对其恶性进展进行了深入研究和探索分析。原始出处：MATTHEW K.

07a97321-147b-3026-b319-8e1fb00b5b24,Evaxion Announces Increased Focus and Fast-Tracking of its New AI Discovery to Patients,"New AI discovery de-risking the pipeline through faster validation and has potential to enter clinical Phase 1/2a in Q4 2023Phase 2b clinical trial reduced in size and expected to reach interim data on time (Q4 2023)Increased focus extends cash runway significantly  COPENHAGEN, Denmark, March  28, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evaxion Biotech A/S (NASDAQ: EVAX) (“Evaxion” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the discovery and development of AI-powered immunotherapies, today announces an increased focus on its strategy around its core AI capabilities allowing fast and de-risked development of its pipeline.   Recently, Evaxion announced that the Company has used its proprietary AI technology to discover a new treatment opportunity that may broaden cancer immunotherapy. Through new cancer targets, so-called ERVs (endogenous retroviruses), it may become possible to treat cancer patients who have until now been considered unresponsive to immunotherapy.  This opens a wide range of opportunities. Notably, it may increase the likelihood of a positive clinical outcome, paving the way for smaller and faster clinical trials. Evaxion’s next clinical program, EVX-03, will target such personalized ERVs and is scheduled to start clinical development in Q4, 2023, subject to additional funding.  CEO, Per Norlén, comments: “Having been at Evaxion for six months, I continue to be excited by the rich potential of our proprietary AI technology, which I believe is world-leading. A natural next step is to maximize the value of our unique AI capabilities by focusing on target discovery and validation and early out-licensing opportunities. We aim to build a pipeline of multiple assets with superior efficacy and diverse partnering opportunities. This is an area where we experience a lot of interest from big pharma.”  The immediate benefits of the new focus are that:  Personalized ERVs are fast-tracked to the clinic with EVX-03, using Evaxion’s novel DNA vaccine technologyEarly-stage pipeline can be expanded through multiple partnerships
Cash runway is extended significantly through the new focus, clinical trial optimization, and staff reductions  CEO, Per Norlén, explains:  “By optimizing the strategy around EVX 01, we can deliver the Phase 2b interim data in Q4 2023 as planned while deploying important clinical resources to EVX-03, where we are likely to be first in the world bringing a personalized ERV-immunotherapy to cancer patients. In addition, the focus on our core will extend our cash runway towards the end of the year.”  About Evaxion  Evaxion Biotech A/S is a pioneering company developing AI-powered immunotherapies. Evaxion’s proprietary and scalable AI technologies decode the human immune system to discover and develop novel immunotherapies for cancer, bacterial diseases, and viral infections.

Data from two cohorts enrolled in the Phase II portion of its ongoing Phase I/II clinical study showed potential for the inhibitor to “
release the brakes
” of “regeneration, reactivation, and preservation” of beta cells, Biomea reported. Beta cells have to work harder in people with type 2 diabetes in order to produce enough insulin to lower blood sugar levels, leading to the loss or weakening of the cells.
The data are still early — the four-week study had 12 patients in each cohort, 10 taking BMF-219 and two on placebo, with patients taking 100 mg once a day for four weeks.
The company highlighted cohort 3 in particular: 89% of patients in cohort 3, which took the dosage without food, saw a reduction in A1c. Specifically, 78% of patients achieved at least a 0.5% reduction in A1c, and 56% achieved at least a 1% reduction in A1c. The median A1c reduction was 1%.
Biomea also pointed out that even four weeks after patients took the last dose, there was continued glycemic control.
Cohort 2 did not quite hit the same numbers: patients had a median A1c reduction of 0.3% and a 70% response rate at four weeks. Thirty percent of patients achieved a >0.5% to <1.0% reduction in A1c.
The two cohorts had similar baseline A1c levels, of 7.9% for cohort 2 and 7.8% for cohort 3. There was a “negative food effect” between the two cohorts, Biomea said. Cohort 3 dosed without food, while cohort 2 dosed with it. The food effect decreased the exposure “significantly.”
The four patients on placebo, meanwhile, had a median A1c and mean A1c reduction between -0.1% to -0.15%.
“Our goal with BMF-219 is to deliver the first disease-modifying treatment for patients with diabetes by addressing the root biological cause of the disease and its inevitable progression: the loss of insulin-producing beta cells,” Thomas Butler, Biomea Fusion’s CEO and chairman of the board, said in a statement.
Encouraged by the initial data, the company plans to test out different dosage levels in the escalation portion of the study and then select the two most promising to move forward with, executives said in an investor call this morning. Future plans include evaluating the candidate in patients with type 1 diabetes."
