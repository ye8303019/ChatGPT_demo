Myopia is a common visual disorder found worldwide
and poses major public health concerns, especially in East
Asian populations. Myopic eyes with long axial lengths
(≥26 mm) or a high degree of myopic refractive error (≤−6 D)
are classified as high myopia [1]. High myopia is associated
with various ocular complications [2], and these pathological
conditions are one of the leading causes of legal blindness in
developed countries [3-5]. Therefore, elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying high myopia and discovering
methods for preventing or delaying its onset are important.
Myopia is a complex disease caused by environmental
and genetic factors. To date, although many studies have
evaluated various candidate genes and susceptible loci of high
myopia [6-11], no single gene has been consistently responsible for the condition. In addition to candidate gene studies,
a genome-wide approach has also been performed by several
groups. Our group previously determined a susceptibility
locus for pathological myopia in 2009, using a genome-wide
association study [12]. In addition, recent genome-wide association studies have revealed myopia susceptibility loci on
chromosome 15 [13,14], and we confirmed that these susceptibility loci are also present in high myopia [15]. However,
susceptibility genes for myopia have not yet been determined.
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is similar to insulin
in function and structure and is a member of a protein family
involved in mediating growth and development. Recently, a
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IGF-1 was reported
to be associated with several types of myopia, including high
myopia, in Caucasians [16]. However, these associations were
not confirmed by a Polish family study that used singlemarker association analysis, a family-based association
test, a pedigree disequilibrium test, and haplotype analysis
[17]. Nevertheless, subsequent Chinese studies reported a
significant association of IGF-1 polymorphisms with high or
extreme myopia; Mak et al. [18] reported an association with
high myopia according to haplotype analysis but not singlemarker analysis, and Zhuang et al. [19] reported an association with extreme myopia but not with high myopia according
to the single-marker and haplotype analyses. The IGF-1

Purpose: To investigate whether genetic variations in the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) gene are associated with
high myopia in Japanese.
Methods: A total of 1,339 unrelated Japanese patients with high myopia (axial length ≥26 mm in both eyes) and two
independent control groups were evaluated (334 cataract patients without high myopia and 1,194 healthy Japanese
individuals). The mean axial length (mm±SD) in the case group was 29.18±1.85 mm, and the mean spherical equivalent
(D±SD) of the phakic eyes was −12.69±4.54 D. We genotyped five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
IGF-1: rs6214, rs978458, rs5742632, rs12423791, and rs2162679. Chi-square tests for trend, multivariable logistic regression, and haplotype regression analysis were conducted.
Results: We found no significant association between the IGF-1 SNPs and high or extreme myopia (axial length ≥28
mm in both eyes, 837 subjects) in the additive model, even when compared with the cataract and general population
controls, with or without adjustments for age and sex. The evaluation using dominant and recessive models also did not
reveal any significant associations. The haplotype analysis with a variable-sized sliding-window strategy also showed a
lack of association of IGF-1 SNPs with high or extreme myopia.
Conclusions: The results of the present study using a Japanese subset do not support the proposal that the IGF-1 gene determines susceptibility to high or extreme myopia in Caucasians and Chinese. Further studies are needed to confirm our
reports in other populations and to identify the underlying genetic determinants of these ocular pathological conditions.

gene is located at a well replicated myopia susceptibility
locus, MYP3 [20-23]. Since several previous animal studies
indicated that insulin and IGF-1 were involved in myopia
development [24-26], resolving these conflicting results and
clarifying whether IGF-1 polymorphisms are indeed associated with high myopia are essential. In the present study,
we conducted a systematic case-control study to validate
the association between polymorphisms of the IGF-1 gene
and high and extreme myopia, using a large cohort of 2,867
unrelated Japanese individuals.
METHODS
Subjects: A total of 1,339 unrelated Japanese patients with
high myopia who had agreed to participate in genomic study
were recruited from the Kyoto University Hospital, Tokyo
Medical and Dental University Hospital, Fukushima Medical
University Hospital, Kobe City Medical Center General
Hospital, and Ozaki Eye Hospital. All the patients underwent
a comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including dilated
indirect and contact lens slit-lamp biomicroscopy, automatic
objective refraction, and measurements of the axial length
by applanation A-scan ultrasonography or partial coherence
interferometry (IOLMaster, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin,
CA). To be classified as having high myopia, the subjects
had to have an axial length ≥26 mm in both eyes. Of the 1,339
patients with high myopia, 837 had extreme myopia, which is
defined as an axial length ≥28 mm in both eyes.
As control subjects, two cohorts were included. One
cohort was composed of selected controls, comprising 334
cataract patients with axial lengths <25.0 mm in both eyes
(control 1). These patients were recruited from the Department of Ophthalmology at Kyoto University Hospital, Ozaki
Eye Hospital, Japanese Red Cross Otsu Hospital, and Nagahama City Hospital. The axial length was measured with
applanation A-scan ultrasonography or partial coherence
interferometry before cataract surgery, and dilated fundus
examination was performed after surgery. If the fundus
examination results revealed myopic changes such as lacquer
cracks/peripapillary atrophy, staphyloma, or choroidal
neovascularization, the subject was eliminated from control
1. The other cohort was composed of general population
controls, comprising 1,194 healthy Japanese individuals
recruited from the Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute,
who had agreed to participate in genomic study (control 2).
All the procedures adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional review board and ethics
committee of each participating institute approved the protocols. All the patients were fully informed of the purpose and
procedures of the study, and written consent was obtained
from each patient.
DNA extraction: Total genomic DNAs were prepared from
14 ml of venous blood. DNA was purified using a DNA
extraction kit (QuickGene-610L, Fujifilm, Minato, Tokyo,
Japan).
Single nucleotide polymorphism selection and genotyping:
We selected tag SNPs in IGF-1 based on HapMap Phase II
(Build 36) genotype data [27] using the Haploview software
(ver. 4.2). Although previous studies tagged relatively minor
SNPs (minor allele frequencies [MAFs] ≥0.05 or 0.10 were
applied), all such minor SNPs showed no association with
high or extreme myopia. In addition, rs6214 and rs12413791,
which were reported to be associated with high and extreme
myopia, respectively, showed a MAF of 43% and 31% in
HapMap JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan). Thus, we tagged all
the major (MAF ≥30%) SNPs that showed a Hardy–Weinberg
p≥0.05. Using a tagger pairwise program provided in Hapmap
project (R2 cutoff of 0.90), we selected five SNPs: rs6214,
rs978458, rs5742632, rs12423791, and rs2162679. These tags
provided 100% coverage of the major HapMap SNPs within
an 84.65-kilobase region spanning the IGF-1 gene.
The samples of the high myopia cases and cataract
controls were genotyped using a commercially available
assay (TaqMan SNP assay with the ABI PRISM 7700 system;
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The individuals
recruited from the Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute were genotyped using Illumina HumanHap 610 chips
(Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Because rs12413791 was
not included in this chip, the genotype for rs12423791 was
imputed using the MACH software, based on the HapMap
Phase II JPT genotype data.
Statistical analyses: Deviations in genotype distributions
from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were assessed
for each group with the chi-square test. The chi-square test for
trend or its exact counterpart was used to compare the genotype distributions of the two groups. To adjust for age and sex,
we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis. In
addition, dominant and recessive models were also calculated
using the chi-square test. These statistical analyses and power
calculation were performed with R software (R Foundation R
2.13.0 for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and PLINK
software (ver. 1.07). We also conducted a haplotype analysis
by using a variable-sized sliding-window strategy [28] using
the PLINK software. p≤0.05 was considered statistically
significant. The Bonferroni correction was used for multiple
comparisons.RESULTS
Demographics of the study population: The demographic
characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.
The axial length of the 2,678 eyes of the 1,339 highly myopic
cases ranged from 26.00 to 39.73 mm, with a mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 29.18±1.85 mm. Among these 2,678
eyes, 1,881 (70.2%) were phakic. Their mean refraction was
−12.69±4.54 D. The axial length of the 668 eyes of the control
1 group ranged from 18.67 to 24.92 mm, with a mean±SD of
22.96±0.87 mm. The mean refraction of the phakic eyes in
control 1 was −0.379±3.01 D. The high myopic cases were
significantly older and more female-dominant than both
control groups (p<0.001).
Genetic distribution: The genotype counts and HWE p value
for the five SNPs in the high myopia, extreme myopia, and
control groups are shown in Table 2. Because we calculated
the HWE p values for 20 genotype distributions, the HWE p
value cutoff was set to 0.0025, using the Bonferroni correction. Thus, the distributions of the genotypes for the five
SNPs were all in HWE.
Genetic association test: We evaluated the association
between each SNP and high myopia using three models: additive, dominant, and recessive. The p values are presented in
Table 3. Although no SNP showed a significant association
with high or extreme myopia in any models when compared
with control 1, the SNP rs5742632 showed a p<0.05 in the
association with extreme myopia when compared with control
2 in the recessive model. However, this SNP did not show
any associations after the multiple comparison correction.
The other SNPs also showed no association with high and
extreme myopia, in any of the models. The lack of association persisted even after an adjustment for age and sex. The
adjusted odds ratios are shown in Appendix 1.
We also conducted a haplotype analysis by using a
variable-sized sliding-window strategy. This analysis also
did not show any significant association. The lowest p=0.147,
which was observed with a five-SNP window (Table 4).
These haplotypes include the rs12423791-rs5742632 haplotype, which has been reported to be associated with extreme
myopia.
The statistical power to detect an association of a risk
allele with an odds ratio of 1.30 at a significance level of 0.01
is more than 99%. In addition, the statistical power calculation revealed that our sample size detected the gene-disease
association for an odds ratio of 1.19 by more than 80%.
DISCUSSION
Here, we report a case-control study of the association of
high and extreme myopia with several polymorphisms,
using two Japanese control cohorts. All of the five tagging
SNPs of IGF-1, including rs6214 and rs12423791, which were
suggested to be associated with high or extreme myopia
in previous studies, showed no association with high and
extreme myopia in the additive, dominant, or recessive model.

IGF-1 was identified as a high myopia-related protein in
two animal model studies. These studies showed that IGF-1
or insulin injection into chick eyes accelerated their axial
elongation, whereas glucagon injection decelerated it [24,25].
Penha et al. [26] indirectly supported this in 2011; they
reported that hyperopic defocus, a cause of axial elongation
of chick eyes, is associated with overexpression of the IGF-1
receptor in chick eyes. In humans, although a significant
association of the IGF-1 SNP with any myopia and with high
myopia was reported in Caucasians in 2010 [16], the association was not confirmed in a Polish family cohort, using the
single-SNP association, family-based association, and pedigree disequilibrium tests [17]. Furthermore, two subsequent
Chinese studies showed a significant association of IGF-1 tag
SNPs with high or extreme myopia [18,19]. However, these
replication studies have limitations due to the evaluation of aIGF-1 was identified as a high myopia-related protein in
