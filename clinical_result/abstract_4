Session title: Novel treatments for MDS II

Background
Magrolimab (Hu5F9-G4) is an antibody blocking CD47, a macrophage immune checkpoint and don’t eat me signal on cancers.  It induces tumor phagocytosis and eliminates leukemia stem cells.  Azacitidine (AZA) synergizes with magrolimab by inducing eat me signals on leukemic blasts, enhancing phagocytosis.   We report here Ph1b data of magrolimab in combination with AZA for untreated higher risk MDS, a potential registrational cohort.

Aims
The aims of this Ph1b study are to determine the safety and efficacy of magrolimab + AZA in untreated higher risk MDS patients.

Methods
Magrolimab + AZA was given to untreated intermediate to very high risk IPSS-R MDS patients. A magrolimab priming/intrapatient dose escalation regimen (1-30 mg/kg QW, Q2W Cycle 3+) was used.  AZA was dosed 75mg/m2 on days 1-7. Efficacy was assessed by IWG 2006 criteria.

Results
39 MDS patients with a median age of 70 years (range 47 – 80) were treated with magrolimab + AZA.  28% were intermediate cytogenetic risk with 64% poor risk (8% unknown/missing).  31% were therapy-related MDS and 13% of all patients were TP53 mutant.  The combo was well tolerated with safety similar to AZA alone. Common treatment-related AEs or AEs of interest were anemia (44%), fatigue (18%), infusion reaction (18%), neutropenia (8%) and thrombocytopenia (5%).  No treatment-related febrile neutropenia was observed.  In addition, no patients discontinued due to an AE. On target anemia was mostly mild, transient and mitigated by the priming dose regimen with many patients decreasing RBC transfusion requirements on therapy.  The mean drop in hemoglobin with the first dose of magrolimab + AZA was only 0.4 g/dL.  In RBC transfusion dependent patients, 58% of patients became transfusion independent.  In 33 efficacy evaluable patients, 30 (91%) had an objective response (42% CR, 24% marrow CR (4/8 also with HI), 3% PR, 21% HI alone, 9% SD).  MDS patient responses deepened over time, with a 56% CR rate in patients with ≥ 6 mo follow-up.  Cytogenetic CRs were seen in 35% of evaluable responding patients. 22% of patients with CR/CRi/marrow CR were MRD negative by multiparameter flow cytometry.  Median time to initial response was rapid at 1.9 months, faster than expected with AZA alone. Median duration of response has not been reached, with a median follow-up of 5.8 mos (range: 2 – 15 mos).  91% of responding patients continue in response at 6 mos.   The median overall survival has also not been reached (range 1.4 – 18.3 mos ongoing) with a 6 mo overall survival estimate of 100%.

Conclusion
Magrolimab is a novel macrophage targeting immunotherapy that with AZA is well tolerated with durable efficacy in MDS.  A potential registration single arm MDS cohort is ongoing (NCT03248479).  ENHANCE, a randomized Ph3 MDS trial of magrolimab + AZA vs. AZA is being initiated. Additional patients, follow up and translational analyses will be reported at time of presentation.
