Abstract
Background
RBN-2397 is a first-in-class PARP7 inhibitor that restores type I interferon signaling and induces an adaptive immune response. Elevated PARP7 expression in cancers of squamous histology and selected other tumor types has identified a potential target population for RBN-2397.

Methods
Patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors were treated with RBN-2397 in the dose escalation phase, followed by dose expansion in 3 tumor-specific cohorts: squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and hormone receptor–positive breast cancer (HR+ BC).

Results
During dose escalation, 50 pts received doses from 25 to 500 mg twice daily (BID); the recommended phase 2 dose was 200 mg BID. Preliminary antitumor activity was observed, with 1 partial response (PR) in HR+ BC and 10 pts with stable disease (SD) >4 months. As of 2 July 2022, 31 pts have been treated at 200 mg BID in 3 expansion cohorts: SCCL (n=13), HNSCC (n=10), and HR+ BC (n=8). Median age (range) was 66 years (43-83) and the median number of prior therapies was 4 (1-8). The disease control rate in response-evaluable pts was 44% in SCCL (SD in 4/9 pts), 71% in HNSCC (RECIST PR for 12+ months in 1/7 [paranasal sinus primary]; SD in 4/7), and 29% in HR+ BC (SD in 2/7). In the overall study population (N=81), RBN-2397–related AEs (all grades >10%) were dysgeusia (40%), fatigue and nausea (20% each), and decreased appetite (14%); Grade 3/4 events (≥2 pts) were diarrhea, anemia, and AST increase (3% each). No significant chronic toxicities were observed. Biomarker analysis showed PARP7 expression in all baseline biopsies evaluated, with expression consistently higher in tumor cells than in stromal cells. On-treatment biopsies confirmed induction of adaptive immunity following RBN-2397 treatment, as evidenced by increases in CD8+ T cells and/or granzyme B expression in most pts across tumor types.

Conclusions
RBN-2397 was well tolerated, and preliminary antitumor activity was observed in both the escalation and expansion cohorts. Biomarker studies confirmed the immunomodulatory mechanism of RBN-2397 and support the ongoing trial in combination with pembrolizumab (NCT05127590).
