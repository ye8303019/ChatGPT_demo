Background: Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) primarily affects older men (OM). In this post-hoc analysis we investigated the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate + prednisone (AAP) in older (≥ 70 years) and younger (< 70 years) patients in PEACE-1. Methods: Men with de novo mCSPC were allocated to standard of care (SOC), SOC + AAP, SOC + radiotherapy (RXT), or SOC + AAP + RXT in this 2x2 design phase 3 trial. SOC was initially androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone, then from Oct 2015 onwards, the use of docetaxel (D) was authorized as part of SOC (at the investigator’s discretion until 2017, then, following the publication of LATITUDE and STAMPEDE trials, accrual was restricted to men receiving ADT+ D). Efficacy and safety in OM included in PEACE-1 were analyzed with the same methods used in the overall trial (Lancet 2022; 399: 1695-1707). Results: A total of 741 younger men (YM) (63%) and 431 OM (37%) were randomized. OM presented with more altered PS (ECOG 1-2) (36% vs 26% p=0.0003) and less frequent use of docetaxel (D) as part of SOC (66% vs 51% p<0.0001) than YM. Hypertension (56,5% vs 38,2%, p<0,001) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (15,5% vs 11%, p=0,029) were significantly more frequent in OM. Median time to AAP discontinuation was shorter (30.0 months [95%CI= 22.1; 35.4] vs 41.4 [95%CI= 31.5; 54.0] independently of D use and more frequently due to adverse events or death in the older than younger population. The benefit of AAP on radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) tended to decrease with age in the overall population: (HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.42-1.01) in OM vs (HR 0.49, 95%CI 0.35-0.69) for YM. The same trend was observed on overall survival (OS): (HR 0.95, 95%CI 0.72-1.25) for OM vs (HR: 0.73, 95%CI 0.58-0.92) for YM. On the other hand, in men fit to receive the SOC composed of ADT+D, the rPFS benefit of AAP was comparable in OM (HR 0.55, 95%CI 0.29-1.04) and in YM (HR 0.5, 95%CI 0.33-0.78). The OS benefit of AAP was: (HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.53-1.2) and (HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.52-0.95) in OM and YM, respectively. Safety data show that severe adverse events (grade 3-5) were more frequent in OM receiving AAP in comparison with YM (69% vs 61%) while there was no difference between older and YM not receiving AAP (48% vs 47%). Conclusions: This post-hoc analysis of PEACE-1 suggests that, in the overall population, OM derive a lower benefit, both in terms of rPFS and OS, from adding AAP to SOC versus YM. This decreased benefit is likely due to more toxicity leading to more frequent and earlier drug discontinuation. Importantly, in OM fit enough to receive ADT+D, the benefit of adding AAP to SOC was comparable to YM. Clinical trial information: NCT01957436.

Background: Radiohybrid (rh) 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 is a novel high affinity prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical. The LIGHTHOUSE study (NCT04186819) evaluated the diagnostic performance of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 in newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Here we report the 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 verified detection rate (VDR), defined as the proportion of patients with M1 lesions identified by blinded image evaluation (BIE) and subsequently confirmed true positive (TP) by biopsy or confirmatory imaging. Methods: Men with treatment-naïve, unfavorable intermediate to very high-risk prostate cancer who were scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy underwent PET 50-70 min after IV administration of 296 MBq 18F-rhPSMA-7.3. Onsite readers interpreted the images before submission for BIE by 3 central readers.Ifthe onsite read indicated M1 disease, verification (by biopsy, surgery or additional imaging) of PET-positive M1 lesions was attempted prior to treatment. 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 M1 VDR was evaluated amongall study patients without major protocol deviations. Results: Of the 335 men analyzed (median [range] PSA, 8.89 [1.15-120] ng/mL), 58 (17%) had M1 lesions by majority read. In total, 34 (10%) had verified M1 lesions with individual readers’ M1 VDR ranging from 10-15%. By region, verified M1 lesions were most common in bone, ranging from 6.0-11% across readers (majority read, 6.6%). Similar data were shown among a subgroup who had negative baseline conventional imaging. In these patients, the VDR ranged from 8.9-13% across readers (majority read, 8.6%). Again, bone showed the highest regional VDR, ranging from 4.8-9.2% (majority read, 5.1%). Conclusions: Further to its clinically meaningful sensitivity and specificity for pelvic lymph node metastases (reported separately), here we show 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET to be a useful staging tool, as distant metastatic lesions were verified in 10-15% of newly diagnosed patients with unfavorable intermediate to very high-risk prostate cancer. Determining the presence of M1 disease prior to surgery may help guide treatment planning by identifying patients for whom surgery is the optimal approach, or those for whom alternatives such as radiation therapy and/or androgen deprivation may be more suitable. Clinical trial information: NCT04186819.

Background: To date, no biomarker of efficacy of nivolumab+/-ipilimumab (N+/-I) or anti-VEGFR TKI has been prospectively validated in mRCC. The BIONIKK trial showed promising objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) with these treatments in first line (L1) after selection by tumour molecular group. We report OS and efficacy results of the second-line (L2) treatment. Methods: BIONIKK is a French multicentre non-comparative phase II trial, randomising 199 mRCC pts to receive N (58), NI (101) or TKI (40) in L1 according to four molecular groups (ccrcc1-4). ORR and PFS were already reported. With an additional follow-up of ≥20 months, we report OS from randomization and from the start of L2, as well as ORR and PFS with a TKI in L2 by molecular group. Results: With a median follow-up of 42.1 months (40.5-45.2), 86 (43%) patients died: 27/58 (46.5%), 39/101 (39%) and 20/40 (50%) in the N, NI, and TKI arm, respectively. Median OS were 43.4 months (95%CI=31.4-NR) with N, 52.7 months (95%CI=46-NR) with NI and 38.1 months (95%CI=33.2-NR) with TKI (table). 175 (88%) patients discontinued first-line treatment, including 20 deaths, and 129 (74%) received a L2, 38/58 (65.5%), 64/101 (63%), and 27/40 (67.5%) after N, NI and TKI, respectively. The most frequent L2 received after N+/-I was a TKI in 96/102 (94%) pts, including cabozantinib in 49, sunitinib/pazopanib in 32, axitinib in 13, and lenvatinib in 2. N was the most frequent L2 after TKI, 20/27 (74%). ORR with TKI in L2 was 28.5% (10/35) after N, 39% (24/61) after NI and 80% (4/5) after TKI, with marked benefit in ccrcc2 pts (table). The mPFS with TKI in L2 was 8.2 (95%CI=6.9-19.3) after N, 11.4 (95%CI= 8.9-16.8) after NI, and 12.1 (95%CI =11.4-NR) months after TKI, with a higher benefit in ccrcc2 pts (vs. ccrcc1+4, p=0.04). Conversely, ORR and mPFS with N after TKI in ccrcc2-pts were 12.5% (2/16) and 5.4 (2.6-NR) months, respectively. Median OS L2 was reported in the table. The updated ORR and PFS in L1 will presented at the Meeting, as well as PFS2 and efficacy by TKI type in L2. Conclusions: We report for the first-time OS and L2 efficacy results by molecular group in a randomized trial. Molecular selection also has an impact on treatment efficacy in L2. These results, together with those reported in L1, can inform clinicians on the best treatment sequence in L1-2. Clinical trial information: NCT02960906.

Background: The possibility to predict the pathologic complete response (pT0) or downstaging (pT≤1) after neoadjuvant therapy may have profound impact on the management of MIBC and orient next-generation bladder-sparing trials. The VIRADS is a standardized reporting system that uses mpMRI parameters to predict the probability of MIBC. No studies have analyzed the ability of VIRADS to predict the pT0 or pT≤1 response post-immunotherapy (IO). Methods: In PURE-01 patients (pts) were staged with bladder multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI: T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast enhancement) before and after treatment (3 cycles of pembro) prior to radical cystectomy (RC). All mpMRI scans were centrally reviewed. Logistic regression models analyzed pre- and post-pembro VIRADS against pT≤1 (primary endpoint) and pT0 (secondary endpoint). VIRADS scores were dichotomized between 0-3 and 4-5. Covariates included cT-stage, age, gender, PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Results: In total, 58 pts were had centrally-reviewed MRI scans (N=116 mpMRI), treated between 02/17 and 08/18. Demographic characteristics and outcomes were generally similar between the all-treated and VIRADS-evaluable populations of PURE-01. Median age was 65 years, 52 (89%) had pure/predominant urothelial carcinoma (UC) histology, 25 (43.1%) had cT3-4N0 MIBC. Pre-pembro: 8 pts (13.8%) had no measurable disease (VIRADS=0), 20 (34.5%) a VIRADS 1-3 score, and 30 (51.7%) had a VIRADS 4-5 score. Six pts (10.3%) had a downstage from VIRADS 4-5 to VIRADS 0-3 post-pembro. Both pre-pembro and post-pembro VIRADS 0-3 scores were significantly associated with pT≤1 endpoint on multivariable analyses (MVA): the strongest effect was seen with post-pembro VIRADS 0-3 against pT≤1 response (OR: 30.2, 95%CI: 6.2-223.2, p<0.0001). The AUC of this model was 0.92. Regarding pre-pembro VIRADS 0-3: OR: 4.35, 95%CI: 1.1-19.7, p=0.04; AUC: 0.83. CPS was another significant variable for pT≤1 endpoint only in MVA using pre-pembro VIRADS 0-3 (OR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1-1.05, p=0.02). Post-pembro VIRADS 0-3 was also associated with pT0 on MVA (OR: 4.59, 95%CI: 1.2-19.6, p=0.02; AUC: 0.78), whereas pre-pembro VIRADS was not (p=0.13). Mean apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were similar between pre- and post-pembro lesions (0.86 vs 0.87). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence establishing the predictivity of the VIRADS score towards the pathological downstaging, both in the pre and post IO settings. Post-pembro VIRADS, along with the combination of pre-pembro VIRADS and CPS, emerged as the strongest features based on which selecting pts for bladder-sparing strategies.

Background: Novel therapies are required for BCG-unresponsive, high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We report the interim results of a Phase II Clinical Study of Intravesical Photo Dynamic Therapy (PDT) in patients with BCG-Unresponsive Carcinoma In-Situ (CIS) with or without papillary disease. Methods: Out of a planned 125 patients, 42 patients have been enrolled and treated with two Study Treatments (Day 0 and Day 180) consisting of an intravesical instillation of the photosensitizer TLD-1433 (0.70 mg/cm2) followed by activation with a 520 nm intravesical laser under general anesthesia (Study Device TLC-3200) to a total of 90 J/cm2 of laser light. The primary outcome assessed was efficacy, evaluated by Complete Response (CR), at any point in time. The secondary outcome was duration of CR at 12 months, post initial CR. A tertiary objective is safety, evaluated by the incidence and severity of Adverse Events, Grade 4 or higher that do not resolve within 450 days post treatment. Patients with a negative cystoscopy and positive cytology have been defined as indeterminate response (IR), as these patients remain under investigation for lower and upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Results: Interim analyses included the first 42 patients, along with 3 patients treated in a preceding Phase Ib NMIBC clinical study assessing the safety of TLD-1433 PDT who weretreated at the same parameters, for a total of 45 patients. Data for the primary and secondary outcomes are listed in the table.The interim clinical data demonstrates a 90 day CR of 50% and a duration of response at 360 and 450 days of 35% and 21%, respectively.There have been eight Serious Adverse Events (SAE) identified (2 Grade II (tachycardia, hematuria), 3 Grade III (acute kidney injury, cellulitis), 2 Grade IV (urosepsis, depression/anxiety) and 1 Grade V). None of the SAEs were deemed to be directly related to the PDT. Conclusions: The interim data support that treatment with Photo Dynamic Therapy provides a viable treatment option for patients with BCG unresponsive CIS (+/- papillary disease) with an acceptable ongoing safety profile. Clinical trial information: NCT03945162.

Background: SG is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an anti-Trop-2 antibody coupled to SN-38, a topoisomerase-I inhibitor, via a proprietary hydrolyzable linker. SG received accelerated FDA approval in April 2021 in pts with mUC who previously received PT-based therapy and a CPI based on the primary analysis of the pivotal TROPHY-U-01 Cohort 1 study. With 9.1 mo median (med) follow-up, SG monotherapy demonstrated a 27% objective response rate (ORR) and med overall survival (OS) of 10.9 mo in 113 pts with locally advanced or mUC progressing after receiving at least a PT-based therapy and a CPI (Tagawa, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021). Here we report updated Cohort 1 outcomes. Methods: TROPHY-U-01 (NCT03547973) is a multicohort, open-label, phase 2 study. Cohort 1 pts (≥18 y) had progression of mUC following PT (as first-line metastatic therapy or as (neo)adjuvant therapy with recurrence/progression ≤12 mo) and CPI, had ECOG PS 0-1, and creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min. Pts received 10 mg/kg of SG intravenously on D1 and D8 of 21-D cycles. The primary endpoint was ORR per central review by RECIST 1.1. Key secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate (CBR), OS, and safety. Results: As of July 26, 2022, med follow-up was 10.5 mo (range, 0.3-40.9) for treated pts (N=113). As previously reported, pts (78% men; med age, 66 y; 66% with visceral metastases, 34% liver), were heavily pretreated with a med of 3 prior therapies (range, 1-8). Med time since last prior therapy was 1.5 mo (range, 0-60.0). At data cutoff, per central review, ORR was 28% (95% CI, 20.2-37.6); CBR was 38% (95% CI, 29.1-47.7), med DOR was 6.1 mo (95% CI, 4.7-9.7, n=32) and med PFS was 5.4 mo (95% CI, 3.5-6.9). Med time to response was 1.6 mo (range, 1.2-5.6) and med OS was 10.9 mo (95% CI, 8.9-13.8). DOR, PFS, and OS rates (95% CI) at 12 mo were 30% (13.6-48.8), 14% (7.2-23.3), and 45% (35.4-53.8), respectively, with 7 (6%) pts still receiving SG at 12 mo. In pts who received prior enfortumab vedotin (n=10) and prior PT in the (neo)adjuvant setting (n=39), results were consistent with the overall population. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 65% of pts and were similar to prior reports; the most common Grade ≥3 TRAEs were neutropenia (35%), leukopenia (18%), anemia (14%), diarrhea (10%), and febrile neutropenia (10%). One treatment-related death occurred due to febrile neutropenia-related sepsis. Conclusions: At 10.5-mo med follow-up, the response rate remains high in pts with heavily pretreated mUC, including pts with visceral metastases, prior EV therapy and prior (neo)adjuvant PT therapy. No new safety signals were observed. These data support the use of SG in pts with mUC who received PT and a CPI and further evaluation of SG in earlier lines of therapy. Clinical trial information: NCT03547973.

Background: Cabozantinib inhibits c-Met, AXL, RET, and VEGFR and has been FDA and EMA approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. In this trial (NCT04066595) we wanted to gain more insights about the potential of Cabozantinib in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and in patients with chemo and/or PD-1- and PD-L1 resistant UC. Methods: This investigator-sponsored Phase II multicenter single-arm trial assessed ORR to Cabozantinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC, who have been pre-treated with checkpoint inhibitors only (cohort 1) or cisplatin-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors (cohort 2). Secondary outcome measurements were PFS, OS, CBR, DOR, and patient safety. All radiologic findings were determined using RECIST 1.1. Patients commenced treatment with Cabozantinib 60 mg given per os once per day continuously. Participants continued on trial as long as their cancer was not worsened and side effects were not too severe. For the assessment of side effects the severity was qualified in accordance with NCI CTCAE, version 5.0. The primary outcome measure of ORR was reported as percentages and associated 95% confidence interval for each cohort. For planning Simon's two-stage minimax design (Simon, 1989) was used. A total of 44 patients (total 88 patients) were planned to be included into each cohort. Results: Seven patients were included in cohort 2. The patients in cohort 2 (N = 7) had a median age of 69 y, 6 male patients and one female patient. All patients had an ECOG PS 0 (n=2) or 1 (n=5). All tumors were originated from the urinary bladder, two of them showing histological subtypes. PD-L1 status was available in two patients. Visceral metastases were evident in 3 patients. At December 20th 2021 data cutoff no patient was alive. The overall response rate was 0%. The median progression free survival was 2,9 months (range 1-5,4 months). The median overall survival was 3 months (range 1-18,3 months) 3 patients showed a stable disease. All patients (n=7) revealed TRAEs, 3 patients each (43%) showed endocrine disorders, metabolic and nutrition disorders and nervous system disorders. In 5 patients (71%) respiratory AEs and in 86% (n=6) gastrointestinal AEs were evident. In 86% of patients (n=6) SAEs led to treatment dose reduction or discontinuation. In 43% of patients (n=3) grade 5 SAEs were evident. Treatment-related SAEs were notified in 57% of patients (n=4). Conclusions: Cabozantinib was administered in 7 patients without clinical response. Due to low patient recruitment and no adequate response rates the study was discontinued early. Cabozantinib in this study does not reveal a clinical benefit for patients with metastatic UC with prior chemotherapy and IO. Clinical trial information: NCT04066595.

Background: Hypomethylating agents (HMA) can augment the anti-tumor immune response. Guadecitabine (G) is a novel HMA shown to induce a dose-dependent decrease of global DNA and gene-specific methylation in pre-clinical models. Methods: This is phase Ib/II clinical trial of Guadecitabine (G) and Durvalumab (D) in advanced ccRCC. Phase Ib tested two doses of G, de-escalated from 60 mg/m2 to 45 mg/m2 in combination with standard dose of D. Followed by two cohorts in phase II. Cohort 1 (C1, CPI naïve) allowed up to one prior line of treatment and Cohort 2 (C2, CPI refractory) enrolled patients with up to two prior systemic therapies including at least one CPI. Primary endpoint in phase 1b was safety, primary endpoint in phase II was overall response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and biomarkers evaluation. Results: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled, 42 were in C1 and 15 in C2. One dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 3 neutropenia was noted with G 60 mg/m2. The combination of G 45 mg/m2 on days 1-5 along with D at 1500 mg on day 8, was deemed safe and the recommended phase II dose. Asymptomatic neutropenia was the most common adverse event (AE). Other AEs included thyroid dysfunction, diarrhea, pneumonitis, myalgia, and hepatotoxicity. No treatment-related deaths were reported. The ORR for C1 and C2 were 26% and 7% respectively. The median PFS for C1 and C2 were 18.4 and 3.9 months respectively. Median OS was not reached. Flow cytometry on peripheral blood (PB) collected before treatment demonstrated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to be inversely associated with response, showing the highest levels in progressive disease (PD) and the lowest in partial response (PR). Responders to treatment had the highest expression of IFN γ, IL-17 and RORyt in CD8+ T cells and lower Foxp3 expression in CD4+ T cells compared to non-responders. We observed a significant increase in serum CXCL9/CXCL10 with the study combination (p 0.00003 and p 0.000005 respectively) and this increase correlated with better clinical outcome. Conclusions: The combination of D and G has an acceptable toxicity profile and promising efficacy mainly PFS in CPI naïve ccRCC patients, that is worth further investigation in larger randomized clinical trial. Clinical trial information: NCT03308396.

Background: Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 27% and median overall survival (OS) of 10.5 months (Mo) in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) patients (pts) progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy and PD1/L1 inhibitor, which led to accelerated US FDA approval in this setting. The combination of SG and pembrolizumab is safe and active following platinum-based chemotherapy. Nivolumab (NIVO) 1mg/kg plus Ipilimumab (IPI) 3mg/kg has shown promising activity in post-platinum mUC pts. Given the potential synergism between immunogenic cell death induced by SG and IPI-NIVO, we hypothesized that the combination of SG and IPI-NIVO would be safe and active as a frontline treatment for cisplatin ineligible mUC. Methods: 3+ 3 design was used for the phase I dose escalation of SG at 8 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose levels. IPI and NIVO were given at 3mg/kg and1mg/kg (I3+N1) intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by NIVO 360 mg IV day 1 every 3 weeks. SG was given IV at days 1,8 every 3 weeks The primary endpoint was safety and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on dose limiting toxicity (DLTs) observed in cycle 1; key secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR, PFS and OS. Key inclusion criteria were ECOG-PS 0-1, cisplatin-ineligibility, treatment naïve, no prior PD1/L1 inhibitor except >3 months earlier for non-metastatic disease. Results: The study has completed the phase I dose escalation after enrolling a total of 9 patients (8 men, 1-woman, median age: 74 years). 6 patients were enrolled at SG 8 mg/kg with 1 DLT, and 3 patients at 10 mg/kg with 2 DLTs. DLTs included grade 3 skin rash (n=2) and grade 3 pneumonitis (n=1). The RP2D of SG was determined to be 8 mg/kg with I3+N1. The most common treatment related adverse events (TRAE) included anemia (66.6%) neutropenia (66.6%), pruritus (66.6%), fatigue (66.6%), diarrhea (66.6%) and lymphopenia (55.5%). 2 patients developed grade 2 infusion reactions to SG. Other grade ≥ 3 TRAE included neutropenia (55.5%), anemia (33.3%), arthralgia (11.1%), and elevated amylase/lipase (11.1%). Both grade 2 pneumonitis and myositis were seen in 1 patient. Of the 9 pts, 6 pts (4 pts at SG dose of 8mg/kg and 2 pts at 10 mg/kg) were considered evaluable for response of whom 4 responded (ORR 66.6%) with 1 complete response and 3 partial responses. Median DOR was 9.2 Mo (range 4.6-12.0); mPFS was 8.8 Mo (95% CI 3.8-NR) and mOS was not reached. Conclusions: The RP2D of SG was identified as 8mg/kg in combination with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg+ Nivolumab 1 mg/kg as first-line therapy for cisplatin-ineligible mUC. Early signals of promising activity were observed in a small cohort of evaluable pts. The Phase 2 trial is ongoing coupled with exploratory biomarker analyses. Clinical trial information: NCT04863885.

Background: Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-RCC) is a rare and highly aggressive cancer mainly caused by germline or somatic aberrant of FH gene. Unfortunately, there are no standard treatment. Here we report the preliminary results of a phase II study investigating the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with axitinib in patients with FH-RCC. Methods: Patients were treated at mutli-center in hospitals of the republic of China. Eligibility criteria included age ≥ 18 years and newly diagnosed as FH-RCC by FH immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Patients received sintilimab (intravenous injection, every 3 week) in combination with axitinib (5mg, orally taken per day) as first-line treatment until disease progression or intolerant to treatment. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; RECIST v1.1). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04387500. Results: Between July 2021 and October 2022, 21 patients were enrolled. At this preliminary analysis (data cutoff, October, 2022), median follow-up was 9 months (0.9-15.2 months). Nineteen patients were available for efficacy assessment. Confirmed complete response rate was 15.8% (3/19), ORR was 63.1% (12/19). Disease-controlled rate (DCR) was 89.4% (17/19). The median of progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached, with a high 12-month PFS rate of 72.3%. All grade and ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 95% (20/21) and 23.8% (5/21), respectively. Conclusions: Sintilimab in combination with Axitinib had a manageable safety profile and achieved a promising tumor response rate in patients with advanced FH-RCC. The trial is an ongoing study, with a total of planned 41 patients from 8 sites. The study start date was June 2, 2021. Clinical trial information: NCT04387500.

Abstract 19P
Background
Improving the results of treatment of patients with stage IIB cervical cancer by introducing the most effective, less toxic chemoradiotherapy at one of the phases of complex or combined treatment.

Methods
This study based on a prospective analysis of 215 women diagnosed with stage IIB cervical cancer. The median age was 47 years (28-64). The patients were divided into two groups: the NACT+S group, 105 patients who recive 2-3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel+carboplatin) followed by surgical treatment. Radiotherapy (1,8 Gy, 45 Gy ± SIB on the metastatically involved lymph nodes 2,2 Gy, 55 Gy) was performed 1-2 months after surgical treatment. Patients also received cycles of cisplatin (40 mg/m2), administered once every week. The second group (CRT group) included 110 patients who underwent radiotherapy (regime was same with NACT+S = 1,8 Gy, 45 Gy ± SIB 2,2 Gy, 55 Gy). Brachytherapy was performed for all patients (6 Gy x 5 fr, to point A 30 Gy).

Results
The median follow-up was 23 months (8-38). In the NACT+S group, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia of the 3 - 4 degree were more common than in the CRT group (6.6% and 7.6% vs. 0.9% and 0.9%, respectively; p = 0.026; p = 0.015). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups studied in relation to the 3 - 4 degree of radiation toxicity of the GI and genitourinary system. 26 cases of disease progression (24.8%) occurred in the NACT+S group, and 15 events (13.6%) occurred in the CRT group; the corresponding 3-year DFS rates were 75.2% and 86.4%, respectively (HR 1.83; 95% CI 1.99-3.40; p = 0.05). Nineteen patients (18.1%) died in the NACT+S group, and 18 patients (15.5%) died in the CRT group, with corresponding 3-year indicators of OS was 81.9% and 84.5%, respectively (HR 1.11; 95% CI from 0.58 to 2.14; p = 0.736).

Conclusions
Cisplatin-based chemoradiation resulted in superior DFS compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery in locally advanced cervical cancer. In the NACT+S group, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia grade 3 or 4 at a higher rate than in the concomitant CRT group. Despite this, there was no significant difference between the two study groups with 3-year indicators of OS and respect to grade 3 or 4 GI and bladder toxicities.

Abstract 10P
Background
Cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women in Uzbekistan. Due to poor accessibility of radiation therapy, especially in remote regions, addition of bevacizumab to platinum containing chemotherapy leads to improvement in overall survival in advanced cervical cancer. We therefore studied addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in a group of cervical cancer patients.

Methods
The prospective study enrolled 54 patients with cervical cancer FIGO IIB stage, who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy: paclitaxel 175mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC6 + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 21 days. The control arm included 55 patients with the same stage cervical cancer, who underwent platinum containing chemotherapy in the same dosage, but without bevacizumab. The response rates were determined by means of preoperative clinical examination, diagnostic imaging (RECIST), changes in tumour markers (SCC) and by histopathology.

Results
Clinical response rate after addition of bevacizumab was found in 88,8% of patients, and 74,5 % of patients who were treated without bevacizumab (p = 0.025), Addition of bevacizumab to platinum containing therapy led to higher rate of clinical complete remission (44.9 vs. 15.5%; p = 0.072). Significant reduction of tumor size was observed in all patients 100% who were treated chemotherapy + bevacizumab, and in 75% cases in patients only chemotherapy, this fact led to higher operability rates in both. The rate of pathological complete response (pCR) was altered significantly 28.6% bevacizumab free therapy vs. 44.5% chemotherapy + bevacizumab (p ≤ 0.005).

Conclusions
Addition of bevacizumab led to avoiding radiation therapy, better clinical response, higher operability and PCR rates. Further validation of angiogenesis Inhibitors in neoadjuvant treatment of cervical cancer needs larger multicentric randomized clinical trials.

Background: Pembrolizumab/axitinib (PAXI) combination is an approved option as first-line therapy of mRCC. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate safety profile of PAXI combo in the real-world experience in Italy. Methods: This is a prospective study including patients (pts) diagnosed with mRCC who received PAXI as first-line therapy in recruiting Italian Centers. Safety data about clinically significant adverse events (AEs), defined as AE requiring corticosteroids, hormone replacement, drug delay, discontinuation or dose reduction were collected. Results: Data from 122 pts treated from January 2021 to September 2022 have been analyzed. With a median follow-up of 10 mos (range 0.2 - 21) and treatment interruption in 35 pts (29%), at landmark 6-mos and 12-mos the treatment was ongoing in 76% (95%CI 0.67-0.83) and 66% of pts (95%CI 0.56-0.75) respectively. In 11% of pts a starting dose of Axi <5mg was reported (8% higher starting dose). 2% of pts experienced Axi dose titration while 37% of pts had a dose reduction. Pts completed a mean of 10 (1 - 31) cycles of Pembro. Toxicity led to treatment discontinuation in 20% (7/35) of cases. Clinically significant AEs occurred in 61% of pts (74), managed with corticosteroids use in 32% (24/74) of pts, hormone replacement (mainly levothyroxine) in 11% (8/74), drug delay in 64% (47/74), discontinuation in 41% (30/74) or dose reduction 18% (13/74). When required, the most used steroid was prednisone (48%) following by dexamethasone (22%), prednisolone (17%), methylprednisolone (13%). Grade 3-4 clinically significant AEs occurred in 25% (18) and 3% (2) of pts respectively, with hepatic injury 33% (6/18) and hypertension 17% (3/18) as the most common reported G3 events. The two G4 AEs reported were pancreatitis and hepatic injury. No treatment-related deaths emerged. In 20% of cases AE were related to Pembro and in 47% of cases to Axi, in 14% to both drugs. In 28% of pts (34/122) a second clinically significant AE occurred, requiring corticosteroids 27% (9/34), hormone replacement 9% (3/34), drug delay 59% (20/34), discontinuation 41% (14/34) or dose reduction 21% (7/34). Grade-3 clinically significant AEs occurred in 29%, with hepatic injury and hypertension (both 3 pts) as the most common events. No grade 4 AEs were reported. The second AE in 21% of cases was related to Pembro and in 59% of cases to Axi, in (9%) to both drugs. Conclusions: PAXI combination had a tolerable safety profile in mRCC, with few high-grade clinically significant AEs, no new toxicities were identified.

Background: For metastatic or unresectable invasive urothelial cancer (UC), standard first-line platinum-based chemotherapy achieved progression-free survival (PFS) of 4–7 months. Complete response (CR) rate is <10%. The minority of patients downstaged after chemotherapy followed by cystectomy still suffer from loss of bladder function and a high risk of recurrence. To improve PFS, CR, and bladder preservation, we explored the use of EV after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or locally advanced UC who desired bladder preservation. Methods: Patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable UC who desired bladder preservation and received EV after platinum-based chemotherapy were identified. CR was defined as no evidence of disease identified on both radiology (MRI+CT) and cystoscopy; PFS were calculated from the date of initial treatment (first-line chemotherapy) to the date of last follow-up/death or recurrence via Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: A total of 12 patients were identified: median age was 69.5 years (range, 52–83); 10 (83%) were men; 9 (75%) partial response and 3 (25%) disease progression were observed from platinum-based chemotherapy. EV was given after platinum-based chemotherapy to all 12 patients who subsequently achieved 100% of response: CR was achieved in 7 (58%) patients, and 4 (33%) remained disease free without ongoing treatment, their disease-free survival (DFS) was 9 months (range, 4–18); 2 patients who achieved CR then recurred as carcinoma in situ (CIS), one of whom had a cystectomy with TisN0 confirmed on final pathology. 2 (17%) patients received radiation to bladder and nodal area. Eleven (92%) patients retained their bladders and no patients died. Median follow-up was 19 months (range, 3.4–53.6). The median duration of EV was 7.5 months (range, 2–20). One-year PFS with bladder intact was 83%. Detailed clinical characteristics and outcome listed on Table. Conclusions: For patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who desired bladder preservation, platinum-based chemotherapy followed by EV with or without pembrolizumab showed encouraging CR and PFS and deserves to be explored further.

Background: Combination intravesical Gemcitabine and Docetaxel (GEMDOCE) has demonstrated benefit for bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) in retrospective series and is now being widely utilized as salvage therapy. BCG therapy is fraught with frequent drug shortages and some patients are unable to tolerate BCG due to side effects. Given ongoing BCG shortages as well as the promising efficacy and tolerability of GEMDOCE as a salvage therapy, our objective was to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravesical GEMDOCE for high-risk (HR) BCG-naïve NMIBC in a prospective manner. Methods: This study is an IRB-approved prospective single-arm open-label phase II trial for patients with BCG-naïve HR NMIBC. Intravesical gemcitabine (1,000 mg)/docetaxel (40 mg) in 100mL normal saline is given weekly for 6 weeks as induction followed by monthly maintenance therapy for 2 years among responders. The primary endpoint was 3-month complete response (CR), defined as a negative bladder biopsy 6 weeks after induction treatment. Secondary endpoints included adverse events (AE) and 12-month CR. Results: To date, the study has fully accrued with 25 patients enrolled from July 2020-August 2022. The pre-trial pathologic stages in our cohort were as follows: HGT1 with CIS (n = 7), HGT1 without CIS (n = 6), HGTa (n = 9), and CIS alone (n = 3) (Table). All 25 patients who completed induction therapy demonstrated CR at 3 months. Eight out of 9 (89%) patients with at least 12 months of follow-up demonstrated continued CR. One patient with HGT1 + CIS on enrollment developed a recurrence at 9 months with HGTa. No enrolled patients have undergone radical cystectomy. Grade 1 AEs were common (19/25 patients, 76%) including hematuria, urinary frequency, urgency, and fatigue. Two patients (8%) experienced a Grade 3 AE including urinary retention and UTI requiring hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. Conclusions: In this ongoing single-arm phase II trial, GEMDOCE appears to be well-tolerated with promising short-term efficacy for patients with BCG-naïve HR NMIBC.
