Background: Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) primarily affects older men (OM). In this post-hoc analysis we investigated the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate + prednisone (AAP) in older (≥ 70 years) and younger (< 70 years) patients in PEACE-1. Methods: Men with de novo mCSPC were allocated to standard of care (SOC), SOC + AAP, SOC + radiotherapy (RXT), or SOC + AAP + RXT in this 2x2 design phase 3 trial. SOC was initially androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone, then from Oct 2015 onwards, the use of docetaxel (D) was authorized as part of SOC (at the investigator’s discretion until 2017, then, following the publication of LATITUDE and STAMPEDE trials, accrual was restricted to men receiving ADT+ D). Efficacy and safety in OM included in PEACE-1 were analyzed with the same methods used in the overall trial (Lancet 2022; 399: 1695-1707). Results: A total of 741 younger men (YM) (63%) and 431 OM (37%) were randomized. OM presented with more altered PS (ECOG 1-2) (36% vs 26% p=0.0003) and less frequent use of docetaxel (D) as part of SOC (66% vs 51% p<0.0001) than YM. Hypertension (56,5% vs 38,2%, p<0,001) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (15,5% vs 11%, p=0,029) were significantly more frequent in OM. Median time to AAP discontinuation was shorter (30.0 months [95%CI= 22.1; 35.4] vs 41.4 [95%CI= 31.5; 54.0] independently of D use and more frequently due to adverse events or death in the older than younger population. The benefit of AAP on radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) tended to decrease with age in the overall population: (HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.42-1.01) in OM vs (HR 0.49, 95%CI 0.35-0.69) for YM. The same trend was observed on overall survival (OS): (HR 0.95, 95%CI 0.72-1.25) for OM vs (HR: 0.73, 95%CI 0.58-0.92) for YM. On the other hand, in men fit to receive the SOC composed of ADT+D, the rPFS benefit of AAP was comparable in OM (HR 0.55, 95%CI 0.29-1.04) and in YM (HR 0.5, 95%CI 0.33-0.78). The OS benefit of AAP was: (HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.53-1.2) and (HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.52-0.95) in OM and YM, respectively. Safety data show that severe adverse events (grade 3-5) were more frequent in OM receiving AAP in comparison with YM (69% vs 61%) while there was no difference between older and YM not receiving AAP (48% vs 47%). Conclusions: This post-hoc analysis of PEACE-1 suggests that, in the overall population, OM derive a lower benefit, both in terms of rPFS and OS, from adding AAP to SOC versus YM. This decreased benefit is likely due to more toxicity leading to more frequent and earlier drug discontinuation. Importantly, in OM fit enough to receive ADT+D, the benefit of adding AAP to SOC was comparable to YM. Clinical trial information: NCT01957436.

Background: Novel therapies are required for BCG-unresponsive, high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We report the interim results of a Phase II Clinical Study of Intravesical Photo Dynamic Therapy (PDT) in patients with BCG-Unresponsive Carcinoma In-Situ (CIS) with or without papillary disease. Methods: Out of a planned 125 patients, 42 patients have been enrolled and treated with two Study Treatments (Day 0 and Day 180) consisting of an intravesical instillation of the photosensitizer TLD-1433 (0.70 mg/cm2) followed by activation with a 520 nm intravesical laser under general anesthesia (Study Device TLC-3200) to a total of 90 J/cm2 of laser light. The primary outcome assessed was efficacy, evaluated by Complete Response (CR), at any point in time. The secondary outcome was duration of CR at 12 months, post initial CR. A tertiary objective is safety, evaluated by the incidence and severity of Adverse Events, Grade 4 or higher that do not resolve within 450 days post treatment. Patients with a negative cystoscopy and positive cytology have been defined as indeterminate response (IR), as these patients remain under investigation for lower and upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Results: Interim analyses included the first 42 patients, along with 3 patients treated in a preceding Phase Ib NMIBC clinical study assessing the safety of TLD-1433 PDT who weretreated at the same parameters, for a total of 45 patients. Data for the primary and secondary outcomes are listed in the table.The interim clinical data demonstrates a 90 day CR of 50% and a duration of response at 360 and 450 days of 35% and 21%, respectively.There have been eight Serious Adverse Events (SAE) identified (2 Grade II (tachycardia, hematuria), 3 Grade III (acute kidney injury, cellulitis), 2 Grade IV (urosepsis, depression/anxiety) and 1 Grade V). None of the SAEs were deemed to be directly related to the PDT. Conclusions: The interim data support that treatment with Photo Dynamic Therapy provides a viable treatment option for patients with BCG unresponsive CIS (+/- papillary disease) with an acceptable ongoing safety profile. Clinical trial information: NCT03945162.

Background: SG is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an anti-Trop-2 antibody coupled to SN-38, a topoisomerase-I inhibitor, via a proprietary hydrolyzable linker. SG received accelerated FDA approval in April 2021 in pts with mUC who previously received PT-based therapy and a CPI based on the primary analysis of the pivotal TROPHY-U-01 Cohort 1 study. With 9.1 mo median (med) follow-up, SG monotherapy demonstrated a 27% objective response rate (ORR) and med overall survival (OS) of 10.9 mo in 113 pts with locally advanced or mUC progressing after receiving at least a PT-based therapy and a CPI (Tagawa, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021). Here we report updated Cohort 1 outcomes. Methods: TROPHY-U-01 (NCT03547973) is a multicohort, open-label, phase 2 study. Cohort 1 pts (≥18 y) had progression of mUC following PT (as first-line metastatic therapy or as (neo)adjuvant therapy with recurrence/progression ≤12 mo) and CPI, had ECOG PS 0-1, and creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min. Pts received 10 mg/kg of SG intravenously on D1 and D8 of 21-D cycles. The primary endpoint was ORR per central review by RECIST 1.1. Key secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate (CBR), OS, and safety. Results: As of July 26, 2022, med follow-up was 10.5 mo (range, 0.3-40.9) for treated pts (N=113). As previously reported, pts (78% men; med age, 66 y; 66% with visceral metastases, 34% liver), were heavily pretreated with a med of 3 prior therapies (range, 1-8). Med time since last prior therapy was 1.5 mo (range, 0-60.0). At data cutoff, per central review, ORR was 28% (95% CI, 20.2-37.6); CBR was 38% (95% CI, 29.1-47.7), med DOR was 6.1 mo (95% CI, 4.7-9.7, n=32) and med PFS was 5.4 mo (95% CI, 3.5-6.9). Med time to response was 1.6 mo (range, 1.2-5.6) and med OS was 10.9 mo (95% CI, 8.9-13.8). DOR, PFS, and OS rates (95% CI) at 12 mo were 30% (13.6-48.8), 14% (7.2-23.3), and 45% (35.4-53.8), respectively, with 7 (6%) pts still receiving SG at 12 mo. In pts who received prior enfortumab vedotin (n=10) and prior PT in the (neo)adjuvant setting (n=39), results were consistent with the overall population. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 65% of pts and were similar to prior reports; the most common Grade ≥3 TRAEs were neutropenia (35%), leukopenia (18%), anemia (14%), diarrhea (10%), and febrile neutropenia (10%). One treatment-related death occurred due to febrile neutropenia-related sepsis. Conclusions: At 10.5-mo med follow-up, the response rate remains high in pts with heavily pretreated mUC, including pts with visceral metastases, prior EV therapy and prior (neo)adjuvant PT therapy. No new safety signals were observed. These data support the use of SG in pts with mUC who received PT and a CPI and further evaluation of SG in earlier lines of therapy. Clinical trial information: NCT03547973.

Background: Hypomethylating agents (HMA) can augment the anti-tumor immune response. Guadecitabine (G) is a novel HMA shown to induce a dose-dependent decrease of global DNA and gene-specific methylation in pre-clinical models. Methods: This is phase Ib/II clinical trial of Guadecitabine (G) and Durvalumab (D) in advanced ccRCC. Phase Ib tested two doses of G, de-escalated from 60 mg/m2 to 45 mg/m2 in combination with standard dose of D. Followed by two cohorts in phase II. Cohort 1 (C1, CPI naïve) allowed up to one prior line of treatment and Cohort 2 (C2, CPI refractory) enrolled patients with up to two prior systemic therapies including at least one CPI. Primary endpoint in phase 1b was safety, primary endpoint in phase II was overall response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and biomarkers evaluation. Results: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled, 42 were in C1 and 15 in C2. One dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 3 neutropenia was noted with G 60 mg/m2. The combination of G 45 mg/m2 on days 1-5 along with D at 1500 mg on day 8, was deemed safe and the recommended phase II dose. Asymptomatic neutropenia was the most common adverse event (AE). Other AEs included thyroid dysfunction, diarrhea, pneumonitis, myalgia, and hepatotoxicity. No treatment-related deaths were reported. The ORR for C1 and C2 were 26% and 7% respectively. The median PFS for C1 and C2 were 18.4 and 3.9 months respectively. Median OS was not reached. Flow cytometry on peripheral blood (PB) collected before treatment demonstrated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to be inversely associated with response, showing the highest levels in progressive disease (PD) and the lowest in partial response (PR). Responders to treatment had the highest expression of IFN γ, IL-17 and RORyt in CD8+ T cells and lower Foxp3 expression in CD4+ T cells compared to non-responders. We observed a significant increase in serum CXCL9/CXCL10 with the study combination (p 0.00003 and p 0.000005 respectively) and this increase correlated with better clinical outcome. Conclusions: The combination of D and G has an acceptable toxicity profile and promising efficacy mainly PFS in CPI naïve ccRCC patients, that is worth further investigation in larger randomized clinical trial. Clinical trial information: NCT03308396.

Background: Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-RCC) is a rare and highly aggressive cancer mainly caused by germline or somatic aberrant of FH gene. Unfortunately, there are no standard treatment. Here we report the preliminary results of a phase II study investigating the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with axitinib in patients with FH-RCC. Methods: Patients were treated at mutli-center in hospitals of the republic of China. Eligibility criteria included age ≥ 18 years and newly diagnosed as FH-RCC by FH immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Patients received sintilimab (intravenous injection, every 3 week) in combination with axitinib (5mg, orally taken per day) as first-line treatment until disease progression or intolerant to treatment. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; RECIST v1.1). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04387500. Results: Between July 2021 and October 2022, 21 patients were enrolled. At this preliminary analysis (data cutoff, October, 2022), median follow-up was 9 months (0.9-15.2 months). Nineteen patients were available for efficacy assessment. Confirmed complete response rate was 15.8% (3/19), ORR was 63.1% (12/19). Disease-controlled rate (DCR) was 89.4% (17/19). The median of progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached, with a high 12-month PFS rate of 72.3%. All grade and ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 95% (20/21) and 23.8% (5/21), respectively. Conclusions: Sintilimab in combination with Axitinib had a manageable safety profile and achieved a promising tumor response rate in patients with advanced FH-RCC. The trial is an ongoing study, with a total of planned 41 patients from 8 sites. The study start date was June 2, 2021. Clinical trial information: NCT04387500.

Background: In the COSMIC-021 phase 1b study (NCT03170960) evaluating cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in advanced solid tumors, this combination therapy demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in patients with advanced non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC) with a median follow-up of 13 mo (Pal. JCO 2021). Results after extended follow-up in nccRCC are presented. Methods: Patients with advanced nccRCC and ECOG PS 0/1 who had ≤1 prior VEGFR-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) were eligible. Prior treatment with TKIs targeting MET or immune checkpoint inhibitors was not allowed. Patients received cabozantinib 40 mg PO QD plus atezolizumab 1200 mg IV Q3W until unacceptable toxicity or progression; dose reductions of cabozantinib (40 mg QD to 20 mg QD, then to 20 mg QOD) were permitted to manage adverse events. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by the investigator; other endpoints included safety, duration of response (DOR), PFS, and OS. Results: The study enrolled 32 patients with nccRCC (2 from dose escalation phase, and 30 from expansion phase of the study): median age, 62 y; male, 81%; ECOG PS 0/1, 75%/25%; histology, papillary/chromophobe/clear cell/other, 47%/28%/3%/22%; sarcomatoid feature, 13%; IMDC risk favorable/intermediate/poor, 50%/41%/9%; ≥3 tumor sites, 56%; tumor sites, lung/kidney/bone/liver, 50%/25%/16%/16%; prior nephrectomy, 63%; prior VEGFR TKI, 22%; 0/1 lines of prior therapy (locally advanced/metastatic setting), 81%/19%. As of July 21, 2022, median follow-up was 37.2 mo (range 32.1–58.5) with 5 (16%) patients remaining on study treatment. ORR by investigator was 31% (all PRs) and disease control rate was 94% (Table); median DOR was 8.1 mo. Median PFS was 9.3 mo (95% CI 5.5–12.3), and median OS was not reached (95% CI 23.0–NE). PFS and OS estimates at 12 mo were 34% and 84%, respectively; 24-mo estimates were 6% and 70%. Treatment-related AEs occurred in 97% (grade 3/4, 53%); the most common AEs included diarrhea (69%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (50%), fatigue (44%), dysgeusia (41%), hypertension (31%) and nausea (31%). One grade 5 treatment-related AE of pulmonary hemorrhage occurred. Treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation of both study treatments occurred in 13% of patients. Conclusions: Extended 3-year follow-up reinforces the encouraging clinical activity of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in advanced nccRCC with a manageable safety profile. Clinical trial information: NCT03170960.

Background: Activation of the GAS6/AXL pathway promotes tumor cell proliferation; high levels of GAS6 and AXL have been associated with drug resistance and decreased survival. Batiraxcept is an ultra-high affinity decoy protein that captures GAS6, preventing it from activating AXL signaling. Serum soluble AXL (sAXL)/GAS6 ratio correlates with response to batiraxcept in advanced ovarian cancer. Batiraxcept in combination with cabozantinib is being evaluated in patients (pts) with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in this study. Prior studies of cabozantinib in similar pt populations have shown an overall response rate (ORR) ranging from 15 – 32.5% and progression-free survival (PFS) from 3.7-7.2 months (mo). Methods: Key eligibility criteria include previously treated ccRCC pts, excluding prior cabozantinib. Objectives were to determine the safety of batiraxcept plus cabozantinib 60 mg, the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), ORR, PFS, duration of response. Correlative endpoints included assessment of baseline serum sAXL/GAS6 with ORR and PFS. Results: In Phase 1b (P1b), 26 pts received at least one dose of batiraxcept with cabozantinib (16 pts - 15 mg/kg; 10 pts - 20 mg/kg). Median age was 60 (range 40-81), male 85% (n=22), IMDC intermediate/poor risk 77% (n=20). All pts received prior immuno-oncology (IO) therapy, 54% (n=14) also received VEGF-TKI; 85% (n=22) received 1 to 2 prior lines of therapy (range 1-6). Median follow-up time was 11.6 mo (range 3.7-18). The RP2D is 15 mg/kg. Related adverse events (AE) any grade and grade ≥ 3 were 100% and 39% (n=10), respectively. Cabozantinib dose reductions occurred in 54% (n=14). AEs of special interest were grade 1 or 2 infusion related reactions, 27% (n=7). Batiraxcept was discontinued due to disease progression 62% (n=16) or toxicity 12% (n=3). The table shows P1b efficacy, ORR of 42%, median PFS of 9.3 mo, and DCR of 84%. Twenty (77%) pts had high baseline sAXL/GAS6 levels; ORR was 55% (11/20) with mPFS of 9.3 mo, compared to 0% ORR and mPFS 6.4 mo in the low sAXL/GAS6 pts. Conclusions: Batiraxcept was well tolerated when combined with cabozantinib. No new safety signals were noted. Efficacy for the combination is encouraging compared to historical cabozantinib monotherapy data. Higher GAS6 levels were predictive for treatment response. The P2 accrual is complete and efficacy data are maturing. A P3 trial plans to evaluate the efficacy in ccRCC patients who have progressed on IO-based and VEGF-TKI therapies. Clinical trial information: NCT04300140.

Background: Current treatments (tx) of papillary NMIBC are not selective. Novel tx can be assessed on measurable disease (eg, a marker lesion) to rapidly and directly assess antitumor efficacy. FGFR inhibitor therapy may improve outcomes for pts with IR-NMIBC with FGFR3/2alt. Erdafitinib (erda) is an oral selective pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer in adults with FGFR3/2alt who have progressed during or following ≥1 line of platinum-containing chemotherapy. THOR-2 (NCT04172675) is a multicohort phase 2 study of erda in pts with NMIBC. We report results in an exploratory cohort of pts with IR-NMIBC with FGFRalt (Cohort 3). Methods: Inclusion: age ≥18 y, with histologically confirmed NMIBC with FGFR3/2alt (local/central testing) and recurrent IR disease, with all previous tumors being low grade (Gr) (Gr 1-2), Ta/T1, no previous carcinoma in situ, risk of progression <5% in the next 2 y, and risk of recurrence >50%. All tumors were removed by transurethral resection of bladder tumor except for a marker lesion (single untouched 5-10 mm lesion). Pts received continuous oral erda 6 mg once daily without uptitration in 28-d cycles. Urine cytology was performed at the time of complete response (CR). Pts with a partial response (PR) or CR ≤3 mos of starting erda continued erda for up to a maximum of 2 y, until progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, investigator decision to discontinue tx, or study closure. Primary exploratory end point: CR rate (CR = disappearance of the marker lesion without any new lesions; if there is a remnant of the marker lesion, no viable tumor should be seen on histopathological examination); key secondary end point: safety. Results: As of the data cutoff (Sep 2022) (median follow-up of 6.2 mos), 10/11 enrolled pts have received erda (enrolled population; median age: 66 y [range 47-77]; 9 Ta, 2 not staged). Pts received erda for a median duration of 2.9 mos (range 1.1-8.4). Efficacy (n=8 evaluable): 6 pts had CR (CR rate, 75.0%; 95% CI, 34.9-96.8%), and 1 had PR. Of 7 pts with CR or PR, median observed duration of response was 2.8 mos. Safety (≥1 dose of erda; n=10): the most common tx-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (90.0%; n=9), diarrhea (60.0%; n=6), dry mouth (50.0%; n=5), dry skin (30.0%; n=3), dysgeusia (30.0%; n=3), and constipation (30.0%; n=3). One pt had Gr ≥3 dysuria (10.0%) and 1 (10.0%) had Gr ≥3 tx-related diarrhea. One pt (10.0%) had Gr 1 tx-related central serous chorioretinopathy. No pts had tx-related serious TEAEs or tx-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation. No deaths occurred. Conclusions: Data from Cohort 3 of THOR-2 demonstrate efficacy in adult pts with IR-NMIBC with FGFRalt. Safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of erda. Clinical trial information: NCT04172675.

Background: In COSMIC-313 (NCT03937219), C+N+I significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with N+I in first-line aRCC of IMDC intermediate or poor risk (Choueiri ESMO 2022). Here, outcomes are analyzed by IMDC risk group. Methods: A total of 855 patients (pts) with clear cell aRCC of IMDC intermediate or poor risk were randomized to receive C 40 mg QD or matched placebo (P), stratified by region and IMDC risk. Both treatment groups received N (3 mg/kg IV Q3W) + I (1 mg/kg IV Q3W) for 4 cycles followed by N (480 mg IV Q4W); N was administered for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was PFS by blinded independent radiology review (BIRC) per RECIST 1.1 in the first 550 randomized pts (PITT population). The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS) in all randomized pts; objective response rate (ORR) and safety were additional endpoints. Results: Overall, 75% of pts were IMDC intermediate and 25% were poor risk. Meaningful differences in baseline characteristics for intermediate vs poor risk in the PITT population were observed for KPS ≥90 (67% vs 47%), prior nephrectomy (71% vs 44%), and ≥2 target/non-target lesions per BIRC (68% vs 83%); characteristics were balanced across treatment arms for intermediate risk but some imbalances were seen for poor risk (42% for C+N+I vs 52% for P+N+I had KPS ≥90 and 37% vs 50% had prior nephrectomy). In intermediate risk pts, PFS was improved with C+N+I (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47–0.85), and ORR and DCR (PITT population) were numerically higher (Table). For poor risk pts, no difference in PFS and ORR was apparent, but DCR was numerically higher with C+N+I. PD as best response was lower with C+N+I vs P+N+I in both risk groups. Duration of response was not reached (NR) in each treatment group. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 74% with C+N+I vs 42% with P+N+I for intermediate risk and 67% vs 38% for poor risk. TRAEs led to discontinuation of all treatment components in 14% vs 5% for intermediate risk and 5% vs 4% for poor risk. Additional analyses relevant to IMDC risk group will be presented. Conclusions: In COSMIC-313, C+N+I improved PFS vs P+N+I in first-line aRCC of IMDC intermediate or poor risk; subgroup analysis suggested that the benefit was primarily in intermediate risk pts. Follow-up for OS is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT03937219.

Background: Small cell/neuroendocrine cancers irrespective of origin share aggressive phenotypes. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a humanized antibody targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) that has shown activity against small cell lung cancers. Preclinical studies showed molecular commonality amongst small cell cancers across multiple tissue types. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy signals of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with small cell/neuroendocrine cancer of the prostate and urothelium. Methods: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic small cell cancer of the bladder (cohort 1) and primary small cell or treatment-derived neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) (cohort 2) received pembrolizumab and standard of care chemotherapy (etoposide and cisplatin/carboplatin for cohorts 1 and 2, with option of docetaxel and carboplatin for cohort 2) with maintenance pembrolizumab for 2 years until unequivocal progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was to estimate ORR, PFS, and OS compared to historical controls as well as safety and tolerability. Targeted gene mutation sequencing as well as sequential single cell sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for immune profiling as well T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was performed. Results: 14 patients were enrolled (7 cohort 1, 7 cohort 2) with mean age 64.9 (range 53 to 81). ORR was 43% (95% CI: 0.06, 0.80) overall and within each cohort. PFS rate at 12 months was 64% (95% CI: 0.44,0.95) across cohorts, 86% (95% CI: 0.63,1.00) within cohort 1, and 43% (95% CI: 0.18,1.00) within cohort 2. OS rate at 12 months was 79% (95% CI: 0.60,1.00) across cohorts, 86% (95% CI: 0.63,1.00) within cohort 1, and 71% (95% CI: 0.45,1.00) within cohort 2. 4 patients in cohort 1 with locally advanced disease underwent radical cystectomy, with no PD at a mean follow up of 29 months. Grade 3 or higher AEs occurred in 87% of patients, while 40% of patients experienced grade 3 or higher AEs related to pembrolizumab. In 12 patients where tissue was sufficient, all patients had genomic alterations in either p53 (75%) or Rb (58%). Single cell sequencing showed progressive enrichment of CD8+ T cells with clonal expansion of specific TCRs in responding patients. Conclusions: In patients with locally advanced or metastatic small cell/neuroendocrine prostate and bladder cancers, combination pembrolizumab with standard of care chemotherapy and maintenance pembrolizumab showed promising efficacy with tolerable adverse events. Clinical trial information: NCT03582475.
