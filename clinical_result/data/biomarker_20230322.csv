Background: Pembrolizumab/axitinib (PAXI) combination is an approved option as first-line therapy of mRCC. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate safety profile of PAXI combo in the real-world experience in Italy. Methods: This is a prospective study including patients (pts) diagnosed with mRCC who received PAXI as first-line therapy in recruiting Italian Centers. Safety data about clinically significant adverse events (AEs), defined as AE requiring corticosteroids, hormone replacement, drug delay, discontinuation or dose reduction were collected. Results: Data from 122 pts treated from January 2021 to September 2022 have been analyzed. With a median follow-up of 10 mos (range 0.2 - 21) and treatment interruption in 35 pts (29%), at landmark 6-mos and 12-mos the treatment was ongoing in 76% (95%CI 0.67-0.83) and 66% of pts (95%CI 0.56-0.75) respectively. In 11% of pts a starting dose of Axi <5mg was reported (8% higher starting dose). 2% of pts experienced Axi dose titration while 37% of pts had a dose reduction. Pts completed a mean of 10 (1 - 31) cycles of Pembro. Toxicity led to treatment discontinuation in 20% (7/35) of cases. Clinically significant AEs occurred in 61% of pts (74), managed with corticosteroids use in 32% (24/74) of pts, hormone replacement (mainly levothyroxine) in 11% (8/74), drug delay in 64% (47/74), discontinuation in 41% (30/74) or dose reduction 18% (13/74). When required, the most used steroid was prednisone (48%) following by dexamethasone (22%), prednisolone (17%), methylprednisolone (13%). Grade 3-4 clinically significant AEs occurred in 25% (18) and 3% (2) of pts respectively, with hepatic injury 33% (6/18) and hypertension 17% (3/18) as the most common reported G3 events. The two G4 AEs reported were pancreatitis and hepatic injury. No treatment-related deaths emerged. In 20% of cases AE were related to Pembro and in 47% of cases to Axi, in 14% to both drugs. In 28% of pts (34/122) a second clinically significant AE occurred, requiring corticosteroids 27% (9/34), hormone replacement 9% (3/34), drug delay 59% (20/34), discontinuation 41% (14/34) or dose reduction 21% (7/34). Grade-3 clinically significant AEs occurred in 29%, with hepatic injury and hypertension (both 3 pts) as the most common events. No grade 4 AEs were reported. The second AE in 21% of cases was related to Pembro and in 59% of cases to Axi, in (9%) to both drugs. Conclusions: PAXI combination had a tolerable safety profile in mRCC, with few high-grade clinically significant AEs, no new toxicities were identified.

Background: Radiohybrid (rh) 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 is a novel high affinity prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical. The LIGHTHOUSE study (NCT04186819) evaluated the diagnostic performance of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 in newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Here we report the 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 verified detection rate (VDR), defined as the proportion of patients with M1 lesions identified by blinded image evaluation (BIE) and subsequently confirmed true positive (TP) by biopsy or confirmatory imaging. Methods: Men with treatment-naïve, unfavorable intermediate to very high-risk prostate cancer who were scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy underwent PET 50-70 min after IV administration of 296 MBq 18F-rhPSMA-7.3. Onsite readers interpreted the images before submission for BIE by 3 central readers.Ifthe onsite read indicated M1 disease, verification (by biopsy, surgery or additional imaging) of PET-positive M1 lesions was attempted prior to treatment. 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 M1 VDR was evaluated amongall study patients without major protocol deviations. Results: Of the 335 men analyzed (median [range] PSA, 8.89 [1.15-120] ng/mL), 58 (17%) had M1 lesions by majority read. In total, 34 (10%) had verified M1 lesions with individual readers’ M1 VDR ranging from 10-15%. By region, verified M1 lesions were most common in bone, ranging from 6.0-11% across readers (majority read, 6.6%). Similar data were shown among a subgroup who had negative baseline conventional imaging. In these patients, the VDR ranged from 8.9-13% across readers (majority read, 8.6%). Again, bone showed the highest regional VDR, ranging from 4.8-9.2% (majority read, 5.1%). Conclusions: Further to its clinically meaningful sensitivity and specificity for pelvic lymph node metastases (reported separately), here we show 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET to be a useful staging tool, as distant metastatic lesions were verified in 10-15% of newly diagnosed patients with unfavorable intermediate to very high-risk prostate cancer. Determining the presence of M1 disease prior to surgery may help guide treatment planning by identifying patients for whom surgery is the optimal approach, or those for whom alternatives such as radiation therapy and/or androgen deprivation may be more suitable. Clinical trial information: NCT04186819.

Background: For metastatic or unresectable invasive urothelial cancer (UC), standard first-line platinum-based chemotherapy achieved progression-free survival (PFS) of 4–7 months. Complete response (CR) rate is <10%. The minority of patients downstaged after chemotherapy followed by cystectomy still suffer from loss of bladder function and a high risk of recurrence. To improve PFS, CR, and bladder preservation, we explored the use of EV after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or locally advanced UC who desired bladder preservation. Methods: Patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable UC who desired bladder preservation and received EV after platinum-based chemotherapy were identified. CR was defined as no evidence of disease identified on both radiology (MRI+CT) and cystoscopy; PFS were calculated from the date of initial treatment (first-line chemotherapy) to the date of last follow-up/death or recurrence via Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: A total of 12 patients were identified: median age was 69.5 years (range, 52–83); 10 (83%) were men; 9 (75%) partial response and 3 (25%) disease progression were observed from platinum-based chemotherapy. EV was given after platinum-based chemotherapy to all 12 patients who subsequently achieved 100% of response: CR was achieved in 7 (58%) patients, and 4 (33%) remained disease free without ongoing treatment, their disease-free survival (DFS) was 9 months (range, 4–18); 2 patients who achieved CR then recurred as carcinoma in situ (CIS), one of whom had a cystectomy with TisN0 confirmed on final pathology. 2 (17%) patients received radiation to bladder and nodal area. Eleven (92%) patients retained their bladders and no patients died. Median follow-up was 19 months (range, 3.4–53.6). The median duration of EV was 7.5 months (range, 2–20). One-year PFS with bladder intact was 83%. Detailed clinical characteristics and outcome listed on Table. Conclusions: For patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who desired bladder preservation, platinum-based chemotherapy followed by EV with or without pembrolizumab showed encouraging CR and PFS and deserves to be explored further.

Background: To date, no biomarker of efficacy of nivolumab+/-ipilimumab (N+/-I) or anti-VEGFR TKI has been prospectively validated in mRCC. The BIONIKK trial showed promising objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) with these treatments in first line (L1) after selection by tumour molecular group. We report OS and efficacy results of the second-line (L2) treatment. Methods: BIONIKK is a French multicentre non-comparative phase II trial, randomising 199 mRCC pts to receive N (58), NI (101) or TKI (40) in L1 according to four molecular groups (ccrcc1-4). ORR and PFS were already reported. With an additional follow-up of ≥20 months, we report OS from randomization and from the start of L2, as well as ORR and PFS with a TKI in L2 by molecular group. Results: With a median follow-up of 42.1 months (40.5-45.2), 86 (43%) patients died: 27/58 (46.5%), 39/101 (39%) and 20/40 (50%) in the N, NI, and TKI arm, respectively. Median OS were 43.4 months (95%CI=31.4-NR) with N, 52.7 months (95%CI=46-NR) with NI and 38.1 months (95%CI=33.2-NR) with TKI (table). 175 (88%) patients discontinued first-line treatment, including 20 deaths, and 129 (74%) received a L2, 38/58 (65.5%), 64/101 (63%), and 27/40 (67.5%) after N, NI and TKI, respectively. The most frequent L2 received after N+/-I was a TKI in 96/102 (94%) pts, including cabozantinib in 49, sunitinib/pazopanib in 32, axitinib in 13, and lenvatinib in 2. N was the most frequent L2 after TKI, 20/27 (74%). ORR with TKI in L2 was 28.5% (10/35) after N, 39% (24/61) after NI and 80% (4/5) after TKI, with marked benefit in ccrcc2 pts (table). The mPFS with TKI in L2 was 8.2 (95%CI=6.9-19.3) after N, 11.4 (95%CI= 8.9-16.8) after NI, and 12.1 (95%CI =11.4-NR) months after TKI, with a higher benefit in ccrcc2 pts (vs. ccrcc1+4, p=0.04). Conversely, ORR and mPFS with N after TKI in ccrcc2-pts were 12.5% (2/16) and 5.4 (2.6-NR) months, respectively. Median OS L2 was reported in the table. The updated ORR and PFS in L1 will presented at the Meeting, as well as PFS2 and efficacy by TKI type in L2. Conclusions: We report for the first-time OS and L2 efficacy results by molecular group in a randomized trial. Molecular selection also has an impact on treatment efficacy in L2. These results, together with those reported in L1, can inform clinicians on the best treatment sequence in L1-2. Clinical trial information: NCT02960906.

Background: The possibility to predict the pathologic complete response (pT0) or downstaging (pT≤1) after neoadjuvant therapy may have profound impact on the management of MIBC and orient next-generation bladder-sparing trials. The VIRADS is a standardized reporting system that uses mpMRI parameters to predict the probability of MIBC. No studies have analyzed the ability of VIRADS to predict the pT0 or pT≤1 response post-immunotherapy (IO). Methods: In PURE-01 patients (pts) were staged with bladder multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI: T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast enhancement) before and after treatment (3 cycles of pembro) prior to radical cystectomy (RC). All mpMRI scans were centrally reviewed. Logistic regression models analyzed pre- and post-pembro VIRADS against pT≤1 (primary endpoint) and pT0 (secondary endpoint). VIRADS scores were dichotomized between 0-3 and 4-5. Covariates included cT-stage, age, gender, PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Results: In total, 58 pts were had centrally-reviewed MRI scans (N=116 mpMRI), treated between 02/17 and 08/18. Demographic characteristics and outcomes were generally similar between the all-treated and VIRADS-evaluable populations of PURE-01. Median age was 65 years, 52 (89%) had pure/predominant urothelial carcinoma (UC) histology, 25 (43.1%) had cT3-4N0 MIBC. Pre-pembro: 8 pts (13.8%) had no measurable disease (VIRADS=0), 20 (34.5%) a VIRADS 1-3 score, and 30 (51.7%) had a VIRADS 4-5 score. Six pts (10.3%) had a downstage from VIRADS 4-5 to VIRADS 0-3 post-pembro. Both pre-pembro and post-pembro VIRADS 0-3 scores were significantly associated with pT≤1 endpoint on multivariable analyses (MVA): the strongest effect was seen with post-pembro VIRADS 0-3 against pT≤1 response (OR: 30.2, 95%CI: 6.2-223.2, p<0.0001). The AUC of this model was 0.92. Regarding pre-pembro VIRADS 0-3: OR: 4.35, 95%CI: 1.1-19.7, p=0.04; AUC: 0.83. CPS was another significant variable for pT≤1 endpoint only in MVA using pre-pembro VIRADS 0-3 (OR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1-1.05, p=0.02). Post-pembro VIRADS 0-3 was also associated with pT0 on MVA (OR: 4.59, 95%CI: 1.2-19.6, p=0.02; AUC: 0.78), whereas pre-pembro VIRADS was not (p=0.13). Mean apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were similar between pre- and post-pembro lesions (0.86 vs 0.87). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence establishing the predictivity of the VIRADS score towards the pathological downstaging, both in the pre and post IO settings. Post-pembro VIRADS, along with the combination of pre-pembro VIRADS and CPS, emerged as the strongest features based on which selecting pts for bladder-sparing strategies. Clinical trial information: NCT02736266.

Background
RIB + ET demonstrated statistically significant progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) benefits in the ML-2, -3, and -7 trials in pts with HR+/HER2− ABC. The presence of visceral mets indicates a worse prognosis, with a particularly poor survival observed in pts with liver mets. Here we report a pooled survival analysis of the ML-2, -3, and -7 trials in pts with visceral mets, including those with liver mets.

Methods
In ML-2, postmenopausal pts were randomized 1:1 to receive first-line (1L) RIB or placebo (PBO) with letrozole. In ML-3, postmenopausal pts were randomized 2:1 to receive RIB or PBO with fulvestrant in the 1L or second-line (2L) setting. In ML-7, premenopausal pts were randomized 1:1 to receive 1L RIB or PBO and goserelin with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI)/tamoxifen (only pts in the NSAI arm were included in this analysis).

Results
A significant PFS and OS benefit was observed with RIB in pts with visceral mets (Table), among which were pts with liver mets or ≥3 met disease sites across the pooled population of 1L/2L. This significant benefit persisted in the 1L subgroup, including in the subgroups of pts with a worse prognosis, such as those with liver mets or ≥3 met sites who achieved a median OS of ≈4-5 y with RIB. No new safety signals, including liver enzyme elevations, even in pts with baseline liver mets, were observed.

Conclusions
This large, pooled analysis of the ML trials confirms the consistent survival benefit of RIB + ET in pts with visceral mets who historically have a poor prognosis. This analysis also demonstrates the substantial benefit of RIB in those with poorer outcomes within the visceral mets subgroup, ie, pts with liver mets and those with multiple met disease sites, especially in the 1L population.

Background: Approximately 40% of patients (pts) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have disease that will relapse or is refractory to chemotherapy and/or immunotherapies; management of these pts remains a challenge. Although follicular lymphoma (FL) generally responds well to first-line treatment (tx), this disease is characterized by frequent relapses with shorter intervals between tx lines. Pts with early relapse (ER) (progressive disease <2 y after initial diagnosis) and those who are double-refractory (DR) to both rituximab and chemotherapy, have particularly poor outcomes. Avadomide (CC-122) is a small molecule oral agent that induces cereblon-mediated degradation of the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos and promotes antilymphoma activity. Results from the dose-escalation part of the CC-122-NHL-001 study demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity of avadomide in combination with obinutuzumab in pts with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) FL. Here, we report long-term safety and efficacy results from the dose-escalation and dose-expansion parts of the CC-122-NHL-001 study in pts with R/R FL.

Methods: CC-122-NHL-001 (NCT02417285) is an ongoing, open-label, phase 1b study of avadomide in combination with obinutuzumab conducted at 8 sites in 3 European countries with dose-escalation and dose-expansion parts in R/R FL. Eligible pts (age ≥18 y) had histologically confirmed, CD20-positive R/R NHL. Pts with FL (grade 1, 2, or 3a) had ≥1 prior standard regimen. Avadomide active ingredient in capsule (1.0-4.0 mg) or formulated capsules (3.0 or 4.0 mg) was administered orally once daily on days 1-5 followed by 2 days off (5/7-day schedule) every week of each 28-day cycle. Obinutuzumab 1000 mg was given intravenously on days 2, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-8. Primary objectives were to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination, including the non-tolerated dose, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Response was assessed using Cheson 2007 criteria every 2 cycles to cycle 6, then every 3 cycles to cycle 12, and every 6 cycles thereafter. Median duration of response (mDOR) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates.

Results: As of January 10, 2020, 73 pts with R/R NHL were enrolled and treated, including 19 with R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 with marginal zone lymphoma, and 53 with R/R FL; all 35 pts in the dose-expansion part of the study had R/R FL. The median age among treated pts was 61 y (range, 26-83), the median number of prior antilymphoma therapies was 3 (range 1-11), and 26 pts (36%) had prior autologous stem cell transplantation. As of July 14, 2020, tx was ongoing in 3/38 pts (8%) in dose-escalation (all ongoing in cycle >24, 1 pt ongoing in cycle >40). In the dose-expansion, tx was ongoing in 15/35 pts (43%); of these pts, all were ongoing in cycle >21 and 1 was ongoing in cycle 30. The RP2D of avadomide was established as 3.0 mg formulated capsule. In the expansion part of the study, pts received a median of 15 tx cycles (range, 1-33), and median tx duration was 60 wk (range, 1-132). The most common (≥10%) grade 3/4 TEAEs were neutropenia, reported in 19 pts (54%) and thrombocytopenia, reported in 7 pts (20%). Sixteen pts (46%) had a serious TEAE; only pyrexia (11%) and sepsis (9%) occurred in >2 pts. The objective response rate (ORR) among the 35 pts with R/R FL in the dose-expansion part of the study was 71%, including 40% with a complete response (CR). The mDOR was 14.6 mo (95% CI, 14.6-not estimable [NE]), and mPFS was 16.4 mo (95% CI, 8.3-NE). The median duration of PFS follow-up in dose-expansion was 14.4 mo (range, 0.8-30.3). Two pts had CRs lasting 13.7 mo and 15.3 mo before discontinuation owing to receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Response rates were similar among all 53 R/R FL pts in both parts of the study (dose escalation and dose expansion) and in high-risk (ER and/or DR) FL pts (Table).

Conclusions: Long-term follow-up results demonstrate that avadomide plus obinutuzumab has a manageable safety profile and durable responses in patients with R/R FL. The antitumor activity of cereblon modulators plus next-generation anti-CD20 antibodies in heavily pretreated R/R NHL warrants further investigation as a novel chemotherapy-free option.",CD20-positive

Abstract
Background: We investigated the efficacy of cetuximab plus irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer and sought associations between the mutation status of the KRAS gene in tumors and clinical response to cetuximab.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer with unresectable metastases to receive FOLFIRI either alone or in combination with cetuximab. The primary end point was progression-free survival.

Results: A total of 599 patients received cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, and 599 received FOLFIRI alone. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival in the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group as compared with the FOLFIRI group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.99; P=0.048). There was no significant difference in the overall survival between the two treatment groups (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.07; P=0.31). There was a significant interaction between treatment group and KRAS mutation status for tumor response (P=0.03) but not for progression-free survival (P=0.07) or overall survival (P=0.44). The hazard ratio for progression-free survival among patients with wild-type-KRAS tumors was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.94), in favor of the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group. The following grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI than with FOLFIRI alone: skin reactions (which were grade 3 only) (in 19.7% vs. 0.2% of patients, P<0.001), infusion-related reactions (in 2.5% vs. 0%, P<0.001), and diarrhea (in 15.7% vs. 10.5%, P=0.008).

Conclusions: First-line treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, as compared with FOLFIRI alone, reduced the risk of progression of metastatic colorectal cancer. The benefit of cetuximab was limited to patients with KRAS wild-type tumors. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00154102.)

Abstract LBA58
Background
The randomized, double-blind, phase 3 ORIENT-31 study was to evaluate sintilimab (sin, anti-PD-1 antibody) with or without IBI305 (bevacizumab biosimilar) plus chemotherapy (chemo), vs chemo, in patients (pts) with EGFRm nsqNSCLC who progressed on EGFR TKIs therapy. The first interim analysis (IA) showed sin + IBI305 + chemo significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) vs chemo alone (Lu, et al. Lancet Oncol 2022).

Methods
Eligible pts were randomized (1:1:1 at the first stage and 2:2:1 at the second stage) into Arm A (sin + IBI305 + chemo), Arm B (sin + placebo [pb] 2 + chemo) and Arm C (pb1 + pb2 + chemo). Sin/pb1 (200 mg), IBI305/pb2 (15 mg/kg), pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) were administered IV Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance treatment of sin/pb1, IBI305/pb2 and pemetrexed. The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by IRRC per RECIST v1.1. Per prespecified statistical analysis plan, the second IA (reported here) aimed to evaluate the PFS between Arm B and Arm C, and the superiority conclusion of Arm A over Arm C has been achieved at the first IA.

Results
By data cutoff (Mar 31, 2022), 476 pts were randomized (Arm A/B/C: 158/158/160). Median age was 57.0 years. 37.0% pts had brain metastasis. Previously, 63.0% pts received 1st or 2nd generation (G) TKI with T790M-, 26.3% pts received 1st or 2nd and then 3rd G TKI with T790M+, and 10.5% pts received first-line 3rd G TKI. With a median follow-up of 13.1 months, median PFS (95% CI) by IRRC was 7.2 months (6.6, 9.3) in Arm A, 5.5 months (4.5, 6.1) in Arm B, and 4.3 months (4.1, 5.3) in Arm C. PFS was significantly improved in Arm B vs Arm C (HR 0.723, 95% CI: 0.552, 0.948; P=0.0181). Confirmed ORR by IRRC was 48.1%, 34.8% and 29.4% in Arm A, B and C respectively; DCR was 86.1%, 81.6% vs 75.6%; median DOR was 8.5 months, 7.4 months vs 5.7 months. Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 59.5%, 46.2%, and 56.9% pts respectively.

Conclusions
Sin combined with or without IBI305 and chemo significantly improved PFS in pts with advanced EGFRm nsqNSCLC who progressed on EGFR-TKI therapy, vs chemo alone.

Abstract
Background: There are no approved epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR T790M mutation after progression on first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs.

Methods: We conducted this phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, and pharmacokinetics of FCN-411, a TKI targeting EGFR, HER2, and HER4, in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC whose disease had progressed during treatment of EGFR-TKIs. Adult patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations (exon 18/19/20/21) who had progressed on prior EGFR-TKIs were enrolled. In the dose-escalation phase, patients received 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, and 16 mg FCN-411 once daily until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In the dose-expansion phase, patients received FCN-411 at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) continuously in 21-day cycles. The primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, MTD, and RP2D.

Results: From July 23, 2018 to September 29, 2020, 77 patients were enrolled, including 30 with EGFR T790M mutation in tumor tissues. The cut-off date was February 1, 2021. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most common grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events among all patients were diarrhea (8; 10.4%) and dermatitis acneiform (7; 9.1%). Ten of 67 evaluable patients achieved confirmed partial response, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 14.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.3-24.0); the ORR was 33.3%, 14.0%, 0, and 25.0% at 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, and 16 mg, respectively. Besides, the ORR in patients without and with EGFR T790M mutation was 20.5% and 7.4%, respectively. Moreover, 39 patients achieved stable disease across all doses, and the disease control rate was 73.1% (95% CI, 60.9-83.2). Median progression-free survival was 4.1 (95% CI, 2.9-5.3) months. Median duration of response and overall survival have not been reached.

Conclusions: FCN-411 was well tolerated and demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC after progression on EGFR-TKIs, especially in those without EGFR T790M mutation. The RP2D was defined as 8 mg once daily. Future studies are warranted.

Background:
In the Phase II Study 19 trial (NCT00753545; Ledermann et al Lancet Oncol 2014), maintenance olaparib improved progression-free survival (PFS) vs placebo in PSR OC pts, including non-BRCAm pts. A significant PFS benefit was also seen with maintenance olaparib vs placebo in gBRCAm PSR OC pts in the Phase III SOLO2 trial (NCT01874353; Pujade-Lauraine et alLancet Oncol 2017). To investigate olaparib maintenance monotherapy in non-gBRCAm PSR OC pts who had received ≥2 prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC), we performed the Phase IIIb, single-arm, OPINION study (NCT03402841).
Methods:
Pts had high-grade serous or endometrioid OC and were in complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to PBC. Pts received maintenance olaparib (tablets; 300 mg bid) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS (modified RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints included PFS by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and somatic BRCA mutation (sBRCAm) status determined by central Myriad tumor and germline testing; and time to first subsequent treatment (TFST). The primary analysis was planned for 18 months (mo) after the last patient was enrolled.
Results:
279 pts were enrolled from 17 countries (mean age: 64 years); 253 pts (90.7%) were confirmed non-gBRCAm. At data cut-off (Oct 2, 2020), median PFS was 9.2 mo (95% CI 7.6–10.9), with 210 PFS events (75.3% maturity). 65.3%, 38.5% and 24.3% of pts were progression-free (PF) at 6, 12 and 18 mo, respectively. The Table shows PFS in key subgroups. Median TFST was 13.9 mo (95% CI 11.5–16.4). Median exposure to olaparib was 9.4 mo (range 0.0–31.9). Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 29.0% of pts and serious TEAEs in 19.7% of pts. TEAEs led to dose interruption, dose reduction and treatment discontinuation in 47.0%, 22.6% and 7.5% of pts, respectively.
Conclusions:
Our findings support the use of olaparib maintenance therapy in non-gBRCAm PSR OC pts, consistent with our interim analysis and previous trials in this setting. Clinical trial information: NCT03402841

Abstract

Background: Pmab, R, and G are fully human monoclonal antibodies that target EGFR, HGF, and IGF-1R, respectively. In part 2 of this 3-part study in previously treated pts with wild-type (WT) KRAS mCRC, pmab+R met the pre-specified criterion for improvement in objective response rate (ORR) whereas pmab+G did not. We report an exploratory analysis of the treatment effect of pmab, R, and G in pts with activating RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2. Methods: Part 2 was a phase II, randomized, double-blinded trial of pmab+R or pmab+G vs. pmab+placebo, administered Q2W until disease progression or intolerance. The primary endpoint was ORR. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. Mutations in KRAS exon 3 (codons 59/61) and exon 4 (codons 117/146); NRAS exon 2 (codons 12/13), exon 3 (codons 59/61), and exon 4 (codons 117/146); and BRAF exon 15 (codon 600) were detected by bidirectional Sanger sequencing. Results: Of 142 pts randomized, 92 (65%) were evaluable for RAS. Of 92 evaluable pts, 79 (86%) were WT RAS (WT in KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4) and 13 (14%) had RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 (mutant in any KRAS exon 3 or 4 or NRAS exon 2, 3, or 4). None of the pts with RAS mutations had an objective response (Table). Of 93 pts evaluable for BRAF, 7 (8%) had V600E mutations (all 7 were WT RAS). Two pts with BRAF V600E tumors had a partial response and were in the pmab+R arm (n=3). No new safety signals were identified. Conclusions: In this small, retrospective study, ORR, PFS and OS were similar between the arms of R or G plus pmab vs pmab alone in pts with WT RAS mCRC tumors. Our findings indicate that RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 impact ORR, PFS, and OS. Clinical trial information: NCT00788957.

Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd.
Background:
Immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) monotherapy showed a lack of response in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. This Phase II study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of toripalimab, a humanized PD-1 mAb plus platinum doublets chemotherapy in EGFR mutant advanced NSCLC patients, who developed resistance to 1st/2nd generation of EGFR TKIs and without T790M mutation.
Methods:
Patients received toripalimab (240 or 360 mg) intravenously combined with carboplatin (AUC = 5) and pemetrexed (500mg/m2) on day 1, Q3W, for up to 6 cycles, followed by toripalimab and pemetrexed maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy was evaluated every six weeks according to RECIST v1.1. PD-L1 expression (JS311 assay) and co-mutation status by whole exome sequencing were further analyzed.
Results:
From Apr 2018 to March 2019, 40 patients were enrolled from 8 centers in China. The median age was 57 years with 53% female, 57.5% EGFR exon19 deletion and 42.5% L858R mutation. By the cutoff date of Jan 2, 2020, 20 partial response and 15 stable disease were observed (ORR 50% and DCR 87.5%) with a median DOR of 7.0 months. The median PFS was 7.0 months and the median OS was still not reached. 52.6% (20/38) patients were PD-L1+ (TPS≥1%) and had numerically higher ORR (60% vs 39%, p= 0.33) and longer PFS (median 8.3 vs 5.7 months, p= 0.61) than PD-L1- patients. Co-mutations analysis revealed common genetic alternations including TP53 (79%), RB1 (18%), ERBB2 (15%), PIK2CA (12%), CDKN2A (12%), HDAC9 (12%) and MET (9%). Patients with TP53 co-mutation responded significantly better in ORR than TP53 wild type patients (62% vs 14%, p= 0.04) . Most frequent TRAE included leukopenia (78%), neutropenia (70%), anemia (70%), ALT elevation (48%), AST elevation (48%) and nausea (48%). Grade 3+ TRAE occurred in 55% patients, including neutropenia (43%), leukopenia (20%) and anemia (13%). Dose delay due to TRAE occurred in 40% patients while 10% patients discontinued treatment due to TRAE.
Conclusions:
Toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy showed promising anti-tumor activity with a manageable safety profile for advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations refractory to TKI therapies. Patients with PD-L1+ tumor biopsy or TP53 co-mutation preferentially responded to the combination. A randomized phase III trial is ongoing to further validate the finding in this study (NCT03924050). Clinical trial information: NCT03513666

Abstract 422P
Background
FOLFOXIRI/BEV represents an option as 1L in mCRC patients (pts). The efficacy of immunotherapy is limited in the MSI subgroup. Combining anti-VEGF antibodies with anti-PD1/PDL1 regulators creates continuous immune stimulation.

Methods
The NIVACOR was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II trial in which mCRC RAS/BRAF mut pts in 1L received NIV 240 mg, FOLFOXIRI (IRI 165 mg/m2, OXA 85 mg/m2, leucovorin 200 mg/m2, and 5-FU 3,200 mg/m2 IC for 48 h) plus BEV 5 mg/kg IV q14 days for 8 cycles and then, NIV/BEV as maintenance until PD or unacceptable toxicities. The primary endpoint was the ORR. According to Fleming’s design with alpha and beta levels of 0.05 and 0.2, in a sample size of 73 pts (comprehensive 10% drop-out rate), at least 56 responses were necessary to not reject the alternative hypothesis of an ORR=0.80.

Results
From October 2019 to March 2021, 73 pts were enrolled in 9 Italian centers. The median (m) age was 60 (51-65); 50.7% were M. The main primary tumor side was right (50.7%) and liver metastases current at 56.2%. The molecular features were: RAS mut 87.7%, BRAF mut 16.2%, both RAS/BRAF mut 4.5%; 10 (13.7%) MSI, and 63 (86.3%) MSS. On December 31, 2021, the (m) follow-up was 14.3 (IQR 11.5-16.5) months (mo) and the duration of treatment was 12 (8-17) cycles. The ORR was 76.7%: 7 (9.6%) CR and 49 (67.1%) PR; 15 (20.6%) SD with a DCR of 97.3%, and 2 (2.7%) were not evaluable. The mDoR was 8.4 mo (95%CI, 7-NE). The mPFS was 10.1 mo (95%CI, 9.4-NE) and 12-mo PFS 53.4%. At data cut-off, 65 (89.1%) pts are still alive. In MSS subgroup, the ORR was 77.8%, mDoR 7.39 mo (95% CI 6.21-9.99), DCR 96.8%, and mPFS 9.73 mo (95%CI 8.71-14.52). The surgery of the primary tumor, metastases, or both, was performed on 6 (8.2%), 9 (9.6%), and 5 (6.9%) pts. The main grade 3-4 toxicities were: neutropenia (G3 21.9%, G4 15.1%), diarrhea (G3 17.8%, G4 1.4%), hypertension and fatigue G3 in 6.8%, and febrile neutropenia G4 (4.1%).

Conclusions
The primary endpoint was met. NIV plus FOLFOXIRI/BEV shows a good activity and safety profile. Promising activity was observed in the MSS pts. These data sustenance the conduction of a randomized-controlled phase III study.

Abstract
Introduction: InO, a humanized anti-CD22 antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, produced superior response rates vs SC for R/R ALL in INO-VATE (complete remission rates [CR]/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi], 80.7% [95% CI, 72.1-87.7] vs 29.4% [21.0-38.8]; 2-sided P <0.001; Kantarjian H. NEJM 2016). Here we report the long-term efficacy and safety of InO vs SC (intensive chemotherapy) in patients with R/R ALL.

Methods: In INO-VATE (NCT01564784), adults with CD22-positive ALL due to receive salvage 1 or salvage 2 treatment were randomized 1:1 to InO (n=164; starting dose 1.8 mg/m2/cycle [0.8 mg/m2 on d 1; 0.5 mg/m2 on d 8 and 15 of a 21-28 d cycle for ≤6 cycles]) or SC (n=162; either fludarabine/high-dose (HD) cytarabine/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, HD Ara-C plus mitoxantrone, or HD Ara-C). Outcomes presented herein include overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), predictors of OS determined by stepwise Cox regression modeling, and safety. Following treatment discontinuation, patients were followed for survival for up to 5 years or 2 years from randomization of the last patient, whichever occurred first.

Results: As of January 5, 2017, median OS follow-up for all randomized patients was 6.6 (range, 0.0‒49.7) mo. OS was longer for InO vs SC with an estimated hazard ratio (HR; InO vs SC) of 0.751 (97.5% CI, 0.568-0.993) and a 1-sided stratified log-rank P=0.0105, indicating a 24.9% reduction in the risk of death in favor of InO (Figure 1). Median OS was 7.7 (95% CI, 6.0-9.2) vs 6.2 (4.7-8.3) mo in InO vs SC pts. At 12 mo, the estimated probability of OS was 33.6% (95% CI, 26.4-40.9) vs 32.0% (24.7-39.6) in InO vs SC patients, respectively, and 22.8% (16.7-29.6) vs 10.0% (5.7-15.5) at 24 mo. InO demonstrated significant improvement in PFS vs SC (HR, 0.450 [97.5% CI, 0.336-0.602]; 1-sided stratified log-rank P ˂0.0001; median PFS, 5.0 [95% CI, 3.9-5.8] vs 1.7 [1.4-2.1] mo). At 12 mo, the estimated probability of PFS was 18.2% (95% CI, 12.3-24.9) vs 4.9% (2.0-9.8) in InO vs SC patients, respectively and 13.2% (8.0-19.8) vs not estimable at 24 mo. In multivariate analysis, longer duration of first remission (continuous; P=0.0157), receiving follow-up hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT; P ˂0.0001), minimal residual disease negativity (best status; P=0.0085), and attaining CR/CRi ( P=0.0214) were associated with lower risk of death in InO patients. In the safety population comprising patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug, 79 (48.2%) InO patients proceeded to HSCT with or without intervening induction or salvage therapy vs 35 (24.5%) SC patients. The most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events were hematologic, primarily cytopenias (InO, 79.9%; SC, 86.7%). Five veno-occlusive disease (VOD) cases (2 in patients with prior HSCT) occurred in InO pts and no VOD occurred in SC patients during treatment or in follow-up without intervening HSCT. Of the 79 InO patients who proceeded to HSCT, 18 (22.8%) experienced VOD (5 in patients with prior HSCT). Of the 35 SC patients who proceeded to HSCT, 3 (8.6%) experienced VOD (1 with prior HSCT).

Conclusions: Long-term follow-up in INO-VATE remained consistent with earlier reports showing that compared with SC, InO produced longer OS, prolonged PFS, and was an effective bridge to HSCT in patients with R/R ALL. Differences in OS were more pronounced at later time points, and differences in PFS were sustained at later time points. The toxicity profile of InO was consistent with previous reports and no new safety concerns were identified.",CD22-positive
