1274P - First-line (1L) nivolumab (NIVO) plus ipilimumab (IPI) in Asian patients (pts) with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) in CheckMate 227

Background
In CheckMate 227 Part 1 (NCT02477826), 1L treatment with NIVO + IPI improved overall survival (OS) vs platinum-doublet chemotherapy (chemo) in pts with aNSCLC. Safety was manageable and consistent with the known profile of NIVO + IPI in NSCLC. We report results in the Asian subpopulation of CheckMate 227.

Methods
Pts with stage IV/recurrent NSCLC, ECOG performance status 0–1, no sensitizing EGFR mutations or known ALK alterations, and no prior systemic therapies were eligible. Pts with PD-L1 ≥ 1% were randomized 1:1:1 to NIVO (3 mg/kg Q2W) + IPI (1 mg/kg Q6W), NIVO alone (240 mg Q2W), or chemo. Pts with PD-L1 < 1% were randomized 1:1:1 to NIVO + IPI, NIVO (360 mg Q3W) + chemo, or chemo. The Asian subpopulation includes pts from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.

Results
A total of 121 Asian pts were randomized to NIVO + IPI and 124 to chemo; baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms. Minimum follow-up for OS was 29.7 mo (database lock, July 2, 2019). Asian pts with PD-L1 ≥ 1% had a 24% reduction in risk of death with NIVO + IPI vs chemo; hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.49–1.17; Table). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.0 mo with NIVO + IPI vs 6.7 mo with chemo (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.43–0.95]). Objective response rates were 54% with NIVO + IPI and 37% with chemo; median duration of response was 26.1 mo and 6.9 mo, respectively. Among all randomized Asian pts (PD-L1 ≥ 1% + < 1%), improved efficacy with NIVO + IPI vs chemo was also observed (Table). Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 40% of pts with NIVO + IPI vs 36% with chemo. Any-grade TRAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 22% vs 13% of pts, respectively. Updated results with a 3-y minimum follow-up will be presented.

Conclusions
As with the global population of CheckMate 227, the Asian subpopulation had improved efficacy with NIVO + IPI vs chemo as 1L treatment for aNSCLC. Safety in the Asian subpopulation was consistent with the global population. Table: 1274P
