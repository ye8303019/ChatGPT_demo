Background: Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) primarily affects older men (OM). In this post-hoc analysis we investigated the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate + prednisone (AAP) in older (≥ 70 years) and younger (< 70 years) patients in PEACE-1. Methods: Men with de novo mCSPC were allocated to standard of care (SOC), SOC + AAP, SOC + radiotherapy (RXT), or SOC + AAP + RXT in this 2x2 design phase 3 trial. SOC was initially androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone, then from Oct 2015 onwards, the use of docetaxel (D) was authorized as part of SOC (at the investigator’s discretion until 2017, then, following the publication of LATITUDE and STAMPEDE trials, accrual was restricted to men receiving ADT+ D). Efficacy and safety in OM included in PEACE-1 were analyzed with the same methods used in the overall trial (Lancet 2022; 399: 1695-1707). Results: A total of 741 younger men (YM) (63%) and 431 OM (37%) were randomized. OM presented with more altered PS (ECOG 1-2) (36% vs 26% p=0.0003) and less frequent use of docetaxel (D) as part of SOC (66% vs 51% p<0.0001) than YM. Hypertension (56,5% vs 38,2%, p<0,001) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (15,5% vs 11%, p=0,029) were significantly more frequent in OM. Median time to AAP discontinuation was shorter (30.0 months [95%CI= 22.1; 35.4] vs 41.4 [95%CI= 31.5; 54.0] independently of D use and more frequently due to adverse events or death in the older than younger population. The benefit of AAP on radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) tended to decrease with age in the overall population: (HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.42-1.01) in OM vs (HR 0.49, 95%CI 0.35-0.69) for YM. The same trend was observed on overall survival (OS): (HR 0.95, 95%CI 0.72-1.25) for OM vs (HR: 0.73, 95%CI 0.58-0.92) for YM. On the other hand, in men fit to receive the SOC composed of ADT+D, the rPFS benefit of AAP was comparable in OM (HR 0.55, 95%CI 0.29-1.04) and in YM (HR 0.5, 95%CI 0.33-0.78). The OS benefit of AAP was: (HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.53-1.2) and (HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.52-0.95) in OM and YM, respectively. Safety data show that severe adverse events (grade 3-5) were more frequent in OM receiving AAP in comparison with YM (69% vs 61%) while there was no difference between older and YM not receiving AAP (48% vs 47%). Conclusions: This post-hoc analysis of PEACE-1 suggests that, in the overall population, OM derive a lower benefit, both in terms of rPFS and OS, from adding AAP to SOC versus YM. This decreased benefit is likely due to more toxicity leading to more frequent and earlier drug discontinuation. Importantly, in OM fit enough to receive ADT+D, the benefit of adding AAP to SOC was comparable to YM. Clinical trial information: NCT01957436.

Background: Radiohybrid (rh) 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 is a novel high affinity prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical. The LIGHTHOUSE study (NCT04186819) evaluated the diagnostic performance of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 in newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Here we report the 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 verified detection rate (VDR), defined as the proportion of patients with M1 lesions identified by blinded image evaluation (BIE) and subsequently confirmed true positive (TP) by biopsy or confirmatory imaging. Methods: Men with treatment-naïve, unfavorable intermediate to very high-risk prostate cancer who were scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy underwent PET 50-70 min after IV administration of 296 MBq 18F-rhPSMA-7.3. Onsite readers interpreted the images before submission for BIE by 3 central readers.Ifthe onsite read indicated M1 disease, verification (by biopsy, surgery or additional imaging) of PET-positive M1 lesions was attempted prior to treatment. 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 M1 VDR was evaluated amongall study patients without major protocol deviations. Results: Of the 335 men analyzed (median [range] PSA, 8.89 [1.15-120] ng/mL), 58 (17%) had M1 lesions by majority read. In total, 34 (10%) had verified M1 lesions with individual readers’ M1 VDR ranging from 10-15%. By region, verified M1 lesions were most common in bone, ranging from 6.0-11% across readers (majority read, 6.6%). Similar data were shown among a subgroup who had negative baseline conventional imaging. In these patients, the VDR ranged from 8.9-13% across readers (majority read, 8.6%). Again, bone showed the highest regional VDR, ranging from 4.8-9.2% (majority read, 5.1%). Conclusions: Further to its clinically meaningful sensitivity and specificity for pelvic lymph node metastases (reported separately), here we show 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET to be a useful staging tool, as distant metastatic lesions were verified in 10-15% of newly diagnosed patients with unfavorable intermediate to very high-risk prostate cancer. Determining the presence of M1 disease prior to surgery may help guide treatment planning by identifying patients for whom surgery is the optimal approach, or those for whom alternatives such as radiation therapy and/or androgen deprivation may be more suitable. Clinical trial information: NCT04186819.

Background: To date, no biomarker of efficacy of nivolumab+/-ipilimumab (N+/-I) or anti-VEGFR TKI has been prospectively validated in mRCC. The BIONIKK trial showed promising objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) with these treatments in first line (L1) after selection by tumour molecular group. We report OS and efficacy results of the second-line (L2) treatment. Methods: BIONIKK is a French multicentre non-comparative phase II trial, randomising 199 mRCC pts to receive N (58), NI (101) or TKI (40) in L1 according to four molecular groups (ccrcc1-4). ORR and PFS were already reported. With an additional follow-up of ≥20 months, we report OS from randomization and from the start of L2, as well as ORR and PFS with a TKI in L2 by molecular group. Results: With a median follow-up of 42.1 months (40.5-45.2), 86 (43%) patients died: 27/58 (46.5%), 39/101 (39%) and 20/40 (50%) in the N, NI, and TKI arm, respectively. Median OS were 43.4 months (95%CI=31.4-NR) with N, 52.7 months (95%CI=46-NR) with NI and 38.1 months (95%CI=33.2-NR) with TKI (table). 175 (88%) patients discontinued first-line treatment, including 20 deaths, and 129 (74%) received a L2, 38/58 (65.5%), 64/101 (63%), and 27/40 (67.5%) after N, NI and TKI, respectively. The most frequent L2 received after N+/-I was a TKI in 96/102 (94%) pts, including cabozantinib in 49, sunitinib/pazopanib in 32, axitinib in 13, and lenvatinib in 2. N was the most frequent L2 after TKI, 20/27 (74%). ORR with TKI in L2 was 28.5% (10/35) after N, 39% (24/61) after NI and 80% (4/5) after TKI, with marked benefit in ccrcc2 pts (table). The mPFS with TKI in L2 was 8.2 (95%CI=6.9-19.3) after N, 11.4 (95%CI= 8.9-16.8) after NI, and 12.1 (95%CI =11.4-NR) months after TKI, with a higher benefit in ccrcc2 pts (vs. ccrcc1+4, p=0.04). Conversely, ORR and mPFS with N after TKI in ccrcc2-pts were 12.5% (2/16) and 5.4 (2.6-NR) months, respectively. Median OS L2 was reported in the table. The updated ORR and PFS in L1 will presented at the Meeting, as well as PFS2 and efficacy by TKI type in L2. Conclusions: We report for the first-time OS and L2 efficacy results by molecular group in a randomized trial. Molecular selection also has an impact on treatment efficacy in L2. These results, together with those reported in L1, can inform clinicians on the best treatment sequence in L1-2. Clinical trial information: NCT02960906.

Background: The possibility to predict the pathologic complete response (pT0) or downstaging (pT≤1) after neoadjuvant therapy may have profound impact on the management of MIBC and orient next-generation bladder-sparing trials. The VIRADS is a standardized reporting system that uses mpMRI parameters to predict the probability of MIBC. No studies have analyzed the ability of VIRADS to predict the pT0 or pT≤1 response post-immunotherapy (IO). Methods: In PURE-01 patients (pts) were staged with bladder multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI: T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast enhancement) before and after treatment (3 cycles of pembro) prior to radical cystectomy (RC). All mpMRI scans were centrally reviewed. Logistic regression models analyzed pre- and post-pembro VIRADS against pT≤1 (primary endpoint) and pT0 (secondary endpoint). VIRADS scores were dichotomized between 0-3 and 4-5. Covariates included cT-stage, age, gender, PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Results: In total, 58 pts were had centrally-reviewed MRI scans (N=116 mpMRI), treated between 02/17 and 08/18. Demographic characteristics and outcomes were generally similar between the all-treated and VIRADS-evaluable populations of PURE-01. Median age was 65 years, 52 (89%) had pure/predominant urothelial carcinoma (UC) histology, 25 (43.1%) had cT3-4N0 MIBC. Pre-pembro: 8 pts (13.8%) had no measurable disease (VIRADS=0), 20 (34.5%) a VIRADS 1-3 score, and 30 (51.7%) had a VIRADS 4-5 score. Six pts (10.3%) had a downstage from VIRADS 4-5 to VIRADS 0-3 post-pembro. Both pre-pembro and post-pembro VIRADS 0-3 scores were significantly associated with pT≤1 endpoint on multivariable analyses (MVA): the strongest effect was seen with post-pembro VIRADS 0-3 against pT≤1 response (OR: 30.2, 95%CI: 6.2-223.2, p<0.0001). The AUC of this model was 0.92. Regarding pre-pembro VIRADS 0-3: OR: 4.35, 95%CI: 1.1-19.7, p=0.04; AUC: 0.83. CPS was another significant variable for pT≤1 endpoint only in MVA using pre-pembro VIRADS 0-3 (OR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1-1.05, p=0.02). Post-pembro VIRADS 0-3 was also associated with pT0 on MVA (OR: 4.59, 95%CI: 1.2-19.6, p=0.02; AUC: 0.78), whereas pre-pembro VIRADS was not (p=0.13). Mean apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were similar between pre- and post-pembro lesions (0.86 vs 0.87). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence establishing the predictivity of the VIRADS score towards the pathological downstaging, both in the pre and post IO settings. Post-pembro VIRADS, along with the combination of pre-pembro VIRADS and CPS, emerged as the strongest features based on which selecting pts for bladder-sparing strategies. Clinical trial information: NCT02736266.

Background: In the COSMIC-021 phase 1b study (NCT03170960) evaluating cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in advanced solid tumors, this combination therapy demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in patients with advanced non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC) with a median follow-up of 13 mo (Pal. JCO 2021). Results after extended follow-up in nccRCC are presented. Methods: Patients with advanced nccRCC and ECOG PS 0/1 who had ≤1 prior VEGFR-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) were eligible. Prior treatment with TKIs targeting MET or immune checkpoint inhibitors was not allowed. Patients received cabozantinib 40 mg PO QD plus atezolizumab 1200 mg IV Q3W until unacceptable toxicity or progression; dose reductions of cabozantinib (40 mg QD to 20 mg QD, then to 20 mg QOD) were permitted to manage adverse events. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by the investigator; other endpoints included safety, duration of response (DOR), PFS, and OS. Results: The study enrolled 32 patients with nccRCC (2 from dose escalation phase, and 30 from expansion phase of the study): median age, 62 y; male, 81%; ECOG PS 0/1, 75%/25%; histology, papillary/chromophobe/clear cell/other, 47%/28%/3%/22%; sarcomatoid feature, 13%; IMDC risk favorable/intermediate/poor, 50%/41%/9%; ≥3 tumor sites, 56%; tumor sites, lung/kidney/bone/liver, 50%/25%/16%/16%; prior nephrectomy, 63%; prior VEGFR TKI, 22%; 0/1 lines of prior therapy (locally advanced/metastatic setting), 81%/19%. As of July 21, 2022, median follow-up was 37.2 mo (range 32.1–58.5) with 5 (16%) patients remaining on study treatment. ORR by investigator was 31% (all PRs) and disease control rate was 94% (Table); median DOR was 8.1 mo. Median PFS was 9.3 mo (95% CI 5.5–12.3), and median OS was not reached (95% CI 23.0–NE). PFS and OS estimates at 12 mo were 34% and 84%, respectively; 24-mo estimates were 6% and 70%. Treatment-related AEs occurred in 97% (grade 3/4, 53%); the most common AEs included diarrhea (69%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (50%), fatigue (44%), dysgeusia (41%), hypertension (31%) and nausea (31%). One grade 5 treatment-related AE of pulmonary hemorrhage occurred. Treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation of both study treatments occurred in 13% of patients. Conclusions: Extended 3-year follow-up reinforces the encouraging clinical activity of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in advanced nccRCC with a manageable safety profile. Clinical trial information: NCT03170960.

Background: Pts with PT-ineligible mUC have limited treatment options following CPI therapies; thus, new treatment options are needed. SG is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an anti-Trop-2 antibody coupled to SN-38, a topoisomerase-I inhibitor, via a proprietary hydrolyzable linker. SG received accelerated FDA approval in April 2021 for pts with mUC who progressed after PT and CPI therapies based on the positive results of the pivotal TROPHY-U-01 Cohort 1 study. In Cohort 1, SG demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 27%, a median overall survival (OS) of 10.9 mo, and a manageable safety profile in 113 pts with locally advanced or mUC (Tagawa, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021). SG demonstrated an ORR of 28% in PT-ineligible pts with mUC who progressed after CPI therapy in preliminary results of the phase 2 TROPHY-U-01 Cohort 2 study (Petrylak et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020). Here, we report the primary analysis of TROPHY-U-01 Cohort 2. Methods: Cohort 2 pts (≥18 y) were PT-ineligible at screening, had ECOG PS 0-1, and creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min. Pts received 10 mg/kg of SG on D1 and D8 of 21-day continuous cycles. The primary endpoint was ORR per central review by RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS), per central review, and OS. Target enrollment was approximately 40 pts. Assuming the second-line ORR of 40%, 40 pts would give a 95% CI with a lower limit of 25% (CI is 0.25 to 0.57) for ORR. Results: As of July 26, 2022, the median follow-up was 9.3 mo (range, 0.5-30.6) for treated pts (N=38); median age, 72.5 y (range, 41-87), 61% male, 50% ECOG PS 1, and 66% visceral metastases (29% liver). Median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 1-5); 50% received prior (neo)adjuvant PT, 18% received prior enfortumab vedotin, and 3% received prior erdafitinib. Median time since last prior anticancer therapy was 1.6 mo (range, 1-8) and median duration of last prior anticancer therapy was 4.2 mo (range, 1-12). Per central review, ORR was 32% (95% CI, 17.5-48.7; 32% partial response); median DOR was 5.6 mo (95% CI, 2.8-13.3; n=12); and median PFS was 5.6 mo (95% CI, 4.1-8.3). Median time to response was 1.4 mo (range, 1.3-1.5) and median OS was 13.5 mo (95% CI, 7.6-15.6). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 68% of pts; the most common Grade ≥3 TRAEs were neutropenia (34%), anemia (21%), leukopenia (18%), fatigue (18%), and diarrhea (16%). TRAEs resulted in an 18% discontinuation rate. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusions: SG monotherapy demonstrated a high response rate with an overall manageable safety profile in PT-ineligible pts with mUC who progressed after CPI therapy. No new safety signals were observed. These data support further evaluation of SG in pts with mUC post CPI therapy. Clinical trial information: NCT03547973.

Background: In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), partial nephrectomy (PN) is indicated for patients with solitary kidney, chronic kidney disease, or bilateral tumors. A subset of these patients, however, may have large and complex renal masses not initially suitable for PN. Neoadjuvant Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor therapy has shown promising results in cytoreducing renal tumors and may permit PN in circumstances not otherwise feasible. Methods: This was a single arm phase II clinical trial of neoadjuvant axitinib in patients with complex (RENAL nephrometry score 10-12 and cT1b-cT3M0) biopsy-proven clear cell RCC with strong indications for partial nephrectomy (PN), and in whom radical nephrectomy may result in dialysis dependence. Axitinib 5 mg was administered orally twice daily for 8 weeks prior to surgery. Primary outcome was reduction in longest tumor diameter; secondary outcomes included tumor response (RECIST), change in RENAL score, feasibility of PN, change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (DeGFR), and post-surgical complications. Results: 26 patients were enrolled. 19 (73.1%) patients had ≥ clinical T3a staged tumors. Post therapy, 17 (65.4%) patients had ≥T3a staged tumors. Axitinib resulted in reductions in tumor size (7.7 vs. 6.3 cm, p<0.001) and RENAL score (11 vs. 10, p <0.001); 9 (34.6%) had partial response, and 17 (65.4%) stable disease by RECIST criteria. PN was successfully performed in 19 (73.1%); 24 (96.8%) achieved negative margins. Six (23.1%) had Clavien III-IV post-surgical complications. Median percentage DeGFR was 14.7%; one (3.8%) patient who had a radical nephrectomy had long-term dialysis dependence. Conclusions: Neoadjuvant axitnib resulted in significant reductions in tumor size and complexity, enabling PN in a cohort of complex renal masses, and with acceptable safety and functional preservation. Clinical trial information: NCT03438708.

Background: ADP-A2M4CD8 is a specific peptide enhanced affinity receptor mixed CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell therapy targeting the cancer testis antigen MAGE-A4 and modified with addition of a CD8α co-receptor designed to provide additional functionality to CD4+ T-cells. ADP-A2M4CD8 has demonstrated an acceptable benefit to risk profile in the Phase 1 SURPASS trial (NCT04044859) in HLA A*02–eligible patients with unresectable or metastatic tumors positive for MAGE-A4.1 Here we report updated clinical outcomes in patients with urothelial cancer (UC). Methods: SURPASS is a first-in-human trial consisting of a modified 3+3 dose-escalation design and an expansion cohort. Autologous T-cells are obtained by leukapheresis, transduced with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector expressing the MAGE-A4-specific T-cell receptor and the CD8α co-receptor, and infused back to the patients as ADP-A2M4CD8 following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Primary and secondary objectives are safety and anti-tumor activity, respectively. Results: At ESMO 2022, we reported promising results from SURPASS in several tumour types.2 In the 43 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 28%, including 1 complete response and 11 partial responses (PR), and an additional 2 unconfirmed PRs awaiting confirmatory scans (as of August 1, 2022). Data from the 7 evaluable patients in the UC subset (updated September 6, 2022) showed that 3 (43%) had a best overall response of PR, and 1 (14%) had an unconfirmed PR. Disease control rate was 100% (3 PR + 1 unconfirmed PR + 3 stable disease). Adverse events have been consistent with those typically observed with lymphodepletion chemotherapy or cellular therapy. This trial is ongoing; data from additional patients with UC treated by January 2023 and updated translational data will be presented. Conclusions: ADP-A2M4CD8 continues to show an acceptable benefit to risk profile in multiple MAGE-A4+ unresectable or metastatic tumors, and preliminary encouraging evidence of efficacy in UC. An additional treatment cohort has been included in the updated trial protocol to evaluate ADP-A2M4CD8 combined with nivolumab. 1. Hong DS, et al. E-poster 540P: ESMO 2021; Virtual. 2.

Background: Adjuvant pembro prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) for patients (pts) with RCC at increased risk of recurrence after nephrectomy in the phase 3 KEYNOTE-564 study (NCT03142334). This post hoc exploratory analysis evaluated efficacy of adjuvant pembro in pt subgroups based on UISS and disease stage. Methods: Pts with histologically confirmed clear cell RCC (pT2, Grade [G] 4 or sarcomatoid, N0, M0; pT3 or pT4, any G, N0, M0; any pT, any G, N+, M0; or M1 NED) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive pembro 200 mg IV or placebo (pbo) every 3 weeks for ≤17 cycles (~1 y). DFS was assessed by investigator. UISS risk groups were derived retrospectively from TNM stage, Fuhrman nuclear grade, and ECOG PS. UISS groups were intermediate risk (pT2, G4, N0, M0; pT3, G1, N0, M0; or pT3, G2-4, N0, M0, ECOG 0), high risk (pT3, G2-4, N0, M0, ECOG PS 1; pT4, any G, N0, M0; or N1, M0), or M1 NED. Other subgroups were evaluated based on disease stage. Results: Baseline characteristics were balanced within subgroups. Median follow-up was 30.1 mo (range 20.8-47.5). Of 994 enrolled pts, most had UISS intermediate risk (n = 732, 73.6%; pembro n = 359; pbo n = 373); 195 pts (19.6%; pembro n = 100; pbo n = 95) had UISS high risk, and 58 pts (5.8%; pembro and pbo n = 29 each) had M1 NED. In the UISS intermediate risk group, the hazard ratio (HR) for DFS was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.88; 24-mo rates, pembro: 81.5%, pbo: 72.4%). In the UISS high-risk group, HR for DFS was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.49-1.20; 24-mo rates, pembro: 65.0%, pbo: 55.9%). In the M1 NED group, HR for DFS was 0.28 (95% CI, 0.12-0.66; 24-mo rates, pembro: 78.4%, pbo: 37.9%). DFS by disease stage is in the Table. Conclusions: Consistent with the results of the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, adjuvant pembro prolonged DFS compared with pbo for all subgroups. Results of this exploratory analysis further support the use of adjuvant pembro after nephrectomy as standard of care for pts with RCC at increased risk of recurrence.

Background: The combination of neutrophil to lymphocyte (NLR), bone metastases and IMDC score in the novel prognostic Meet-URO score has shown a higher prognostic performance than the IMDC score alone in mRCC pts receiving ≥2nd line nivolumab or cabozantinib in two retrospective analyses and 1st line nivolumab-ipilimumab in a real-world prospective study [http://bit.ly/Meet-URO15_score]. Further validation is needed since this score represents an easy prognostic tool for clinical practice with no additional costs. Methods: A real-world analysis of elderly (≥70 yo) mRCC pts treated with any line cabozantinib was conducted in the multicenter observational prospective Zebra study. Baseline Meet-URO score was assessed. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and the Harrell’s c-index was calculated to compare accuracy of survival prediction of the Meet-URO and IMDC scores. Results: 104 mRCC pts received cabozantinib as 1st (38%), 2nd (20%), 3rd (33%) and 4th (8%) line, with a median follow-up of 11.2 months (mo) and a median overall survival (mOS) of 18.4 mo. According to the IMDC score, favorable- (15%), intermediate- (65%) and poor-risk (19%) pts had a mOS not reached (NR), 15.6 and of 5.7 mo, respectively (p = 0.011). Reclassifying the population according to the Meet-URO score, we observed that group 1 (10%) and group 2 (25%) had both mOS NR, whereas group 3 (33%), group 4 (25%) and group 5 (8%) had a mOS of 13.6, 12.5 and 3.7 mo, respectively (p = 0.001). Moreover, the Meet-URO score maintained its discrimination ability also merging group 1-2 vs 3-4 vs 5 (p < 0.001). NLR < 3.2 was the heaviest component of the score (p < 0.001, mOS 24.8 vs 11.5 mo). The Meet-URO score (using both original with 5 groups and modified with 3 groups) has shown a higher prognostic power than the IMDC score alone (c-index of 0.686 and 0.676 vs 0.622). Conclusions: This analysis confirmed the higher accuracy in survival stratification of the Meet-URO score compared with the IMDC score alone also in a specific population like elderly mRCC pts treated with cabozantinib. NLR was confirmed as a strong prognostic factor with cabozantinib. Further applications of the Meet-URO score in mRCC pts treated with first-line immune-combinations are planned and highly awaited.

Background: Novel therapies are required for BCG-unresponsive, high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We report the interim results of a Phase II Clinical Study of Intravesical Photo Dynamic Therapy (PDT) in patients with BCG-Unresponsive Carcinoma In-Situ (CIS) with or without papillary disease. Methods: Out of a planned 125 patients, 42 patients have been enrolled and treated with two Study Treatments (Day 0 and Day 180) consisting of an intravesical instillation of the photosensitizer TLD-1433 (0.70 mg/cm2) followed by activation with a 520 nm intravesical laser under general anesthesia (Study Device TLC-3200) to a total of 90 J/cm2 of laser light. The primary outcome assessed was efficacy, evaluated by Complete Response (CR), at any point in time. The secondary outcome was duration of CR at 12 months, post initial CR. A tertiary objective is safety, evaluated by the incidence and severity of Adverse Events, Grade 4 or higher that do not resolve within 450 days post treatment. Patients with a negative cystoscopy and positive cytology have been defined as indeterminate response (IR), as these patients remain under investigation for lower and upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Results: Interim analyses included the first 42 patients, along with 3 patients treated in a preceding Phase Ib NMIBC clinical study assessing the safety of TLD-1433 PDT who weretreated at the same parameters, for a total of 45 patients. Data for the primary and secondary outcomes are listed in the table.The interim clinical data demonstrates a 90 day CR of 50% and a duration of response at 360 and 450 days of 35% and 21%, respectively.There have been eight Serious Adverse Events (SAE) identified (2 Grade II (tachycardia, hematuria), 3 Grade III (acute kidney injury, cellulitis), 2 Grade IV (urosepsis, depression/anxiety) and 1 Grade V). None of the SAEs were deemed to be directly related to the PDT. Conclusions: The interim data support that treatment with Photo Dynamic Therapy provides a viable treatment option for patients with BCG unresponsive CIS (+/- papillary disease) with an acceptable ongoing safety profile. Clinical trial information: NCT03945162.

Background: Cabozantinib inhibits c-Met, AXL, RET, and VEGFR and has been FDA and EMA approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. In this trial (NCT04066595) we wanted to gain more insights about the potential of Cabozantinib in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and in patients with chemo and/or PD-1- and PD-L1 resistant UC. Methods: This investigator-sponsored Phase II multicenter single-arm trial assessed ORR to Cabozantinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC, who have been pre-treated with checkpoint inhibitors only (cohort 1) or cisplatin-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors (cohort 2). Secondary outcome measurements were PFS, OS, CBR, DOR, and patient safety. All radiologic findings were determined using RECIST 1.1. Patients commenced treatment with Cabozantinib 60 mg given per os once per day continuously. Participants continued on trial as long as their cancer was not worsened and side effects were not too severe. For the assessment of side effects the severity was qualified in accordance with NCI CTCAE, version 5.0. The primary outcome measure of ORR was reported as percentages and associated 95% confidence interval for each cohort. For planning Simon's two-stage minimax design (Simon, 1989) was used. A total of 44 patients (total 88 patients) were planned to be included into each cohort. Results: Seven patients were included in cohort 2. The patients in cohort 2 (N = 7) had a median age of 69 y, 6 male patients and one female patient. All patients had an ECOG PS 0 (n=2) or 1 (n=5). All tumors were originated from the urinary bladder, two of them showing histological subtypes. PD-L1 status was available in two patients. Visceral metastases were evident in 3 patients. At December 20th 2021 data cutoff no patient was alive. The overall response rate was 0%. The median progression free survival was 2,9 months (range 1-5,4 months). The median overall survival was 3 months (range 1-18,3 months) 3 patients showed a stable disease. All patients (n=7) revealed TRAEs, 3 patients each (43%) showed endocrine disorders, metabolic and nutrition disorders and nervous system disorders. In 5 patients (71%) respiratory AEs and in 86% (n=6) gastrointestinal AEs were evident. In 86% of patients (n=6) SAEs led to treatment dose reduction or discontinuation. In 43% of patients (n=3) grade 5 SAEs were evident. Treatment-related SAEs were notified in 57% of patients (n=4). Conclusions: Cabozantinib was administered in 7 patients without clinical response. Due to low patient recruitment and no adequate response rates the study was discontinued early. Cabozantinib in this study does not reveal a clinical benefit for patients with metastatic UC with prior chemotherapy and IO. Clinical trial information: NCT04066595.

Background: Hypomethylating agents (HMA) can augment the anti-tumor immune response. Guadecitabine (G) is a novel HMA shown to induce a dose-dependent decrease of global DNA and gene-specific methylation in pre-clinical models. Methods: This is phase Ib/II clinical trial of Guadecitabine (G) and Durvalumab (D) in advanced ccRCC. Phase Ib tested two doses of G, de-escalated from 60 mg/m2 to 45 mg/m2 in combination with standard dose of D. Followed by two cohorts in phase II. Cohort 1 (C1, CPI naïve) allowed up to one prior line of treatment and Cohort 2 (C2, CPI refractory) enrolled patients with up to two prior systemic therapies including at least one CPI. Primary endpoint in phase 1b was safety, primary endpoint in phase II was overall response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and biomarkers evaluation. Results: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled, 42 were in C1 and 15 in C2. One dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 3 neutropenia was noted with G 60 mg/m2. The combination of G 45 mg/m2 on days 1-5 along with D at 1500 mg on day 8, was deemed safe and the recommended phase II dose. Asymptomatic neutropenia was the most common adverse event (AE). Other AEs included thyroid dysfunction, diarrhea, pneumonitis, myalgia, and hepatotoxicity. No treatment-related deaths were reported. The ORR for C1 and C2 were 26% and 7% respectively. The median PFS for C1 and C2 were 18.4 and 3.9 months respectively. Median OS was not reached. Flow cytometry on peripheral blood (PB) collected before treatment demonstrated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to be inversely associated with response, showing the highest levels in progressive disease (PD) and the lowest in partial response (PR). Responders to treatment had the highest expression of IFN γ, IL-17 and RORyt in CD8+ T cells and lower Foxp3 expression in CD4+ T cells compared to non-responders. We observed a significant increase in serum CXCL9/CXCL10 with the study combination (p 0.00003 and p 0.000005 respectively) and this increase correlated with better clinical outcome. Conclusions: The combination of D and G has an acceptable toxicity profile and promising efficacy mainly PFS in CPI naïve ccRCC patients, that is worth further investigation in larger randomized clinical trial. Clinical trial information: NCT03308396.

Background: Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 27% and median overall survival (OS) of 10.5 months (Mo) in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) patients (pts) progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy and PD1/L1 inhibitor, which led to accelerated US FDA approval in this setting. The combination of SG and pembrolizumab is safe and active following platinum-based chemotherapy. Nivolumab (NIVO) 1mg/kg plus Ipilimumab (IPI) 3mg/kg has shown promising activity in post-platinum mUC pts. Given the potential synergism between immunogenic cell death induced by SG and IPI-NIVO, we hypothesized that the combination of SG and IPI-NIVO would be safe and active as a frontline treatment for cisplatin ineligible mUC. Methods: 3+ 3 design was used for the phase I dose escalation of SG at 8 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose levels. IPI and NIVO were given at 3mg/kg and1mg/kg (I3+N1) intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by NIVO 360 mg IV day 1 every 3 weeks. SG was given IV at days 1,8 every 3 weeks The primary endpoint was safety and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on dose limiting toxicity (DLTs) observed in cycle 1; key secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR, PFS and OS. Key inclusion criteria were ECOG-PS 0-1, cisplatin-ineligibility, treatment naïve, no prior PD1/L1 inhibitor except >3 months earlier for non-metastatic disease. Results: The study has completed the phase I dose escalation after enrolling a total of 9 patients (8 men, 1-woman, median age: 74 years). 6 patients were enrolled at SG 8 mg/kg with 1 DLT, and 3 patients at 10 mg/kg with 2 DLTs. DLTs included grade 3 skin rash (n=2) and grade 3 pneumonitis (n=1). The RP2D of SG was determined to be 8 mg/kg with I3+N1. The most common treatment related adverse events (TRAE) included anemia (66.6%) neutropenia (66.6%), pruritus (66.6%), fatigue (66.6%), diarrhea (66.6%) and lymphopenia (55.5%). 2 patients developed grade 2 infusion reactions to SG. Other grade ≥ 3 TRAE included neutropenia (55.5%), anemia (33.3%), arthralgia (11.1%), and elevated amylase/lipase (11.1%). Both grade 2 pneumonitis and myositis were seen in 1 patient. Of the 9 pts, 6 pts (4 pts at SG dose of 8mg/kg and 2 pts at 10 mg/kg) were considered evaluable for response of whom 4 responded (ORR 66.6%) with 1 complete response and 3 partial responses. Median DOR was 9.2 Mo (range 4.6-12.0); mPFS was 8.8 Mo (95% CI 3.8-NR) and mOS was not reached. Conclusions: The RP2D of SG was identified as 8mg/kg in combination with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg+ Nivolumab 1 mg/kg as first-line therapy for cisplatin-ineligible mUC. Early signals of promising activity were observed in a small cohort of evaluable pts. The Phase 2 trial is ongoing coupled with exploratory biomarker analyses. Clinical trial information: NCT04863885.

Background: Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-RCC) is a rare and highly aggressive cancer mainly caused by germline or somatic aberrant of FH gene. Unfortunately, there are no standard treatment. Here we report the preliminary results of a phase II study investigating the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with axitinib in patients with FH-RCC. Methods: Patients were treated at mutli-center in hospitals of the republic of China. Eligibility criteria included age ≥ 18 years and newly diagnosed as FH-RCC by FH immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Patients received sintilimab (intravenous injection, every 3 week) in combination with axitinib (5mg, orally taken per day) as first-line treatment until disease progression or intolerant to treatment. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; RECIST v1.1). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04387500. Results: Between July 2021 and October 2022, 21 patients were enrolled. At this preliminary analysis (data cutoff, October, 2022), median follow-up was 9 months (0.9-15.2 months). Nineteen patients were available for efficacy assessment. Confirmed complete response rate was 15.8% (3/19), ORR was 63.1% (12/19). Disease-controlled rate (DCR) was 89.4% (17/19). The median of progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached, with a high 12-month PFS rate of 72.3%. All grade and ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 95% (20/21) and 23.8% (5/21), respectively. Conclusions: Sintilimab in combination with Axitinib had a manageable safety profile and achieved a promising tumor response rate in patients with advanced FH-RCC. The trial is an ongoing study, with a total of planned 41 patients from 8 sites. The study start date was June 2, 2021. Clinical trial information: NCT04387500.
