Background: In the COSMIC-021 phase 1b study (NCT03170960) evaluating cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in advanced solid tumors, this combination therapy demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in patients with advanced non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC) with a median follow-up of 13 mo (Pal. JCO 2021). Results after extended follow-up in nccRCC are presented. Methods: Patients with advanced nccRCC and ECOG PS 0/1 who had ≤1 prior VEGFR-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) were eligible. Prior treatment with TKIs targeting MET or immune checkpoint inhibitors was not allowed. Patients received cabozantinib 40 mg PO QD plus atezolizumab 1200 mg IV Q3W until unacceptable toxicity or progression; dose reductions of cabozantinib (40 mg QD to 20 mg QD, then to 20 mg QOD) were permitted to manage adverse events. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by the investigator; other endpoints included safety, duration of response (DOR), PFS, and OS. Results: The study enrolled 32 patients with nccRCC (2 from dose escalation phase, and 30 from expansion phase of the study): median age, 62 y; male, 81%; ECOG PS 0/1, 75%/25%; histology, papillary/chromophobe/clear cell/other, 47%/28%/3%/22%; sarcomatoid feature, 13%; IMDC risk favorable/intermediate/poor, 50%/41%/9%; ≥3 tumor sites, 56%; tumor sites, lung/kidney/bone/liver, 50%/25%/16%/16%; prior nephrectomy, 63%; prior VEGFR TKI, 22%; 0/1 lines of prior therapy (locally advanced/metastatic setting), 81%/19%. As of July 21, 2022, median follow-up was 37.2 mo (range 32.1–58.5) with 5 (16%) patients remaining on study treatment. ORR by investigator was 31% (all PRs) and disease control rate was 94% (Table); median DOR was 8.1 mo. Median PFS was 9.3 mo (95% CI 5.5–12.3), and median OS was not reached (95% CI 23.0–NE). PFS and OS estimates at 12 mo were 34% and 84%, respectively; 24-mo estimates were 6% and 70%. Treatment-related AEs occurred in 97% (grade 3/4, 53%); the most common AEs included diarrhea (69%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (50%), fatigue (44%), dysgeusia (41%), hypertension (31%) and nausea (31%). One grade 5 treatment-related AE of pulmonary hemorrhage occurred. Treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation of both study treatments occurred in 13% of patients. Conclusions: Extended 3-year follow-up reinforces the encouraging clinical activity of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in advanced nccRCC with a manageable safety profile.
